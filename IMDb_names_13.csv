Tobin is passionate about writing gritty and dramatic screenplays that reveal the underbelly of society, portraying social issues that the common person would rather not address directly. He illustrates the human experiences of those typically viewed as subhuman and contaminated, such as a homeless crust punk, or a teenage prostitute, as in his second developed screenplay Jodye (pre-production). His undergraduate degree in sociology and master's degree in special education provide a unique lens in which Tobin views the world. In addition to his passion for writing and producing full-length dramas, Tobin is the creative mind and writer behind a number of short films, often crossing genres into dark comedy.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0

nm9462972,Rafael Durand,Rafael Durand,,"Born in 1987 in Mexico City, Rafael Durand has been working in many big and small music studios composing and producing music for publicity, documentaries and original music for artists from the age of 19.He constantly releases music as part of the band Frege and his experimental solo project Siifoo. Both are heavily influenced by mixed-meter composition. Frege's music has been described by some press articles as fragmented pop and electro-soul and it's a seamless blend between complex rhythmical ideas and simple repetitive vocal melodies that enables the listener to forget about the mixed-meter complexity that holds the music continuously flowing and changing. Frege have had collaborations with artists such as Simon Balthazar (Fanfarlo, Swoon), La Chica and Tessa Ia.Durand collaborates with other musicians and artists around the world. As a music producer he've worked with Gordon Raphael (Producer of The Strokes, Blonde Redhead and more), Simon Balthazar, Patterns, La Chica, Pollo Bruxo, Noa Sainz, Bicho Blanco, Leonardo de Lozanne, An An and many more. In dance, he composed music for internationally acclaimed dance company Nohbords for three pieces: La Piel, Solsticio and C-ro. In film he was awarded for best music by the festival 48hrs Film Project for the short film Numen, he also composed score for the short film El Cielo en el Lago and the feature film El Vestido (in collaboration with Simon Balthazar).In visual arts he produced cover art for Swoon's debut album, The Guadaloops Lumina videoclip, Kris Berle's State of Mind single and more. He also collaborates with other multidisciplinary artists such as Tania Reza, Natalia Gomez and Diego Mur. His work has been exhibited in France, Canada and Mexico. He's given lectures and workshops on code and art at Mexico's Art Laboratory Alameda and Center of Digital Culture and Art Location.Durand's unique mix of interests and studies of technology; analog equipment and algorithmic composition techniques on one hand and music theory; his love for classical, modern and contemporary masters and jazz music on the other, is an effort to consolidate a relationship between art and technology, analog and digital, traditional and modern into one single scrutiny.","August 18, 1987 in Mexico City, Distrito Federal, Mexico",1987-08-18,"Mexico City, Distrito Federal, Mexico",,,,,,0,0,0,0

Time is ticking so let's get it all in.""With his band, the modern rock six-piece Whole Damn Mess, Miggs has toured with Rock and Roll Hall of Fame artists like ZZ Top and Cheap Trick, recorded with legends such as Mick Fleetwood and Tower of Power, and released a handful of acclaimed albums. The songwriting is dense and deep, tackling the relatable themes of love, marriage, family life, and staying connected to the moment even when your wildest dreams come true. Referring to his music as ""adult punk rock"" due to its infectious energy and ability to connect to fans both young and old, the new Whole Damn Mess album is mixed by rock stalwart and perennial Grammy-nominee Mark Needham and serves as a new high-water musical mark for Miggs and company.""I've played music with people I used to study on album covers and I've toured rooms I only dreamed about,"" he says. ""But I don't know many artists who can unequivocally state that they are making their best music this many years on. It may be 'critically satisfying' or 'mature' but I'm writing my best material now. I'm still shooting to be your new favorite artist-just older.""Miggs prides himself on being an ace husband and father, and when not working on music he prefers to be working in those capacities first and foremost. But his other passions never sleep, and so he makes time by any means necessary to pursue those other aforementioned endeavors, while also maintaining a healthy lifestyle of playing tennis, working out, traveling, and more. He has written the first volume of his ""Know Best"" book series called ""Dads Know Best,"" hosts a weekly FM radio show discussing everything from big-picture ideas about life to relatable minutia, has scored a handful of film soundtracks (his latest with Billy Corgan of Smashing Pumpkins), helps to run a music publishing company and three fashion brands...it's enough to make your head spin.And yet, through it all, Miggs maintains an even keel and simply chalks it up to work ethic, passion, and fearlessness. Having learned from some of the era's brightest, boldest, and best, many of whom he considers firsthand friends and accomplices, Miggs belongs to a select group of rock star humanitarians-some of whom are actual rock stars, while others embody the descriptor in their respective field-who fight for causes and speak for justice both onstage and off. ""I'm drawn to people who care enough to lay it on the line and who aren't afraid of their flaws,"" he says. ""People like Eddie Vedder, Bruce Springsteen, and Bono, who know the power of being generous of spirit and heart when chasing their muse or commanding a stage.""And yet, for a world-beating personality like Miggs who has been to the top of so many mountains and dined at the tables of so many elites, the man still maintains a humble profile. Viewing himself as more of a conduit for inspiration and energy than a role model, Miggs strives to live each day to its fullest and to never stop believing in his own abilities-to connect, to protect, and to prevail.""I've always felt like I represent most people,"" he says. ""For me, the American Dream is being able to do what you're passionate about to feed yourself and your family. And if you get, you give-it's that simple. If people follow me it's because they know I won't give up. I collect good people with solid intentions to join me. But I'm as hungry as anyone you've ever met and still believe today will be the day I paint my masterpiece. I'm just getting started.""",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0

nm9749626,Sebnem Ferah,Sebnem Ferah,155,"Sebnem Ferah (born in Yalova, Turkey) is a Turkish singer, songwriter, composer, and guitarist. She was the lead vocalist of the all-female hard rock band ""Volvox"" until 1994, after which she went on to pursue an illustrious solo career. Her music style varies from pop rock to hard rock though her later albums have progressively incorporated more of the hard rock sound.She first took solfeggio and instrument lessons from her father who was also a teacher. She grew up listening to her father's Rumelian folk songs played with baglama, mandolin and piano. She got her first guitar when she was in the first year in boarding at Namik Sözeri High School of Bursa. She got acoustic lessons. During her second year, she hired a studio with her friends and formed the group Pegasus. The group had their first stage appearance during a rock festival in Bursa, in 1987. After a while, Pegasus disbanded. In 1988, Sebnem formed Volvox with four friends of her that they named after the microorganism known as volvox, which they encountered in a biology lesson. In 1998, she provided the voice of Ariel for The Little Mermaid.After graduating from high school, she attended Middle East Technical University, studying economics, and moved to Ankara with her sister. During this time, she met Özlem Tekin, who has later become another recognized pop-rock musician in Turkey, and Özlem joined Volvox. Volvox could not practice for a year and a half because the members experienced a hardship with coming together, with the other members except Özlem and Sebnem living in Istanbul. In her second year at the university, Sebnem changed her mind about being an economist; instead she dropped out and moved back to Istanbul. In Istanbul, she attended classes on English language and literature at the Istanbul University. For two years she performed in various bars with Volvox until dissolution of the band in 1994.Although short-lived, Volvox gave Ferah what she needed: attention from professionals. Turkish diva Sezen Aksu and Aksu's writing/recording partner Onno Tunç saw Volvox on television. In a short time, Ferah sang back vocals for Sezen Aksu.In 1996 Ferah released her first album ""Kadin"", which contained some of her best songs, ""Vazgeçtim Dünyadan"", ""Yagmurlar"", ""Bu Ask Fazla Sana"", and ""Firtina"" to name a few. They featured a rather polished and clean production, possibly the effect of producer Iskender Paydas; these came off much differently from how she would later perform the songs live. ""Kadin"" was a huge hit and lots of club and arena gigs followed its release.Three years later, Ferah came into the scene with her second album, ""Artik Kisa Cümleler Kuruyorum"". She was working with the same production team of Iskender Paydas and members of Pentagram, but she had mostly broken free of artificial synths that time. Being a decent rock album, it was more introverted due to death of Sebnem's sister prior to its release. With less catchy songs, Ferah also started to create a fan base who would sing and feel all her lyrics rather than a following who would only memorize the hits and ignore the rest.In 2001, Ferah came up with a more acoustic third album, ""Perdeler"", two years after her father died at 1999 Izmit earthquake. Apart from the lead single ""Sigara"", ""Perdeler"" fell short of creating hits. She also collaborated with Finnish band Apocalyptica on the title track.Her next step was the fourth album ""Kelimeler Yetse (If Words Were Enough)"", which was released in 2003. The album was a low point in her career although it included ""Ben Sarkimi Söylerken"" (""While I'm Singing My Song)"" and ""Mayin Tarlasi"" (""Minefield)"".In 2005, she released her fifth studio album ""Can Kiriklari"", produced by Tarkan Gözübüyük. The album showcased her heavier side and was yet her most distortion-friendly outing. After her nationwide concert tour, a live CD/DVD 10 Mart 2007 Istanbul Konseri was released in 2007.In December 2009, she released her sixth and recent studio album ""Benim Adim Orman"", features slow rock song like ""Bazi Asklar"" and ""Eski"" while there were hard rock song like, ""Merhaba"" and ""Mahalle"". This album indicates her point of view for rock music.","April 12, 1972 in Yalova, Turkey",1972-04-12,"Yalova, Turkey",,,,,,0,0,0,0

At two years old, she moved back home to Louisiana with her parents and her older brother, Jude. In 2002, the family moved to Ft. Gordon, GA when her dad was mobilized following the 9/11 terrorist attacks. As a ""military brat"", Mack lived in several different places at a young age. Mack was shy as a child and always clung to her mom and dad in crowds. However, it became obvious at an early age that she was a performer and loved to make people laugh. Her parents and close family friends would often comment on her hilarious antics, funny accents, and goofy movements (she loved the ladies of SNL); but it wasn't until her early teens that she became comfortable enough to let her outgoing and goofy personality show in public. She attended a local musical theatre variety show to see her brother perform when she was 12 years old, and she was instantly hooked and in awe of the older girls who were performing. This set the stage for her love of performing arts. She quickly signed up for dancing, acting, and voice lessons and began auditioning for various roles at the local performing arts academy. With full support from the community and her family, Mack continued to dance, sing, and act throughout middle and high school. While she loved performing on stage, it didn't take long for her to find that her heart was in Film/TV acting. She signed with an agent, Open Range, while still in high school and began auditioning for roles throughout Louisiana and the Southeast. She attended Louisiana State University for only one semester when she got her first big break, landing the role of ""Bug"" in ""Darlin'"", starring Pollyanna McIntosh. Any doubts she had about pursuing a career in film were demolished after filming for ""Darlin'"" in south Louisiana. She booked her first television role in ""The Purge"" , filming in New Orleans. While on set filming for ""The Purge"", she got her next big break when she landed the role of Bess Marvin in ""Nancy Drew and the Hidden Staircase"".",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0

Having ROTC already on the resume, Donald entered military service the next year as a firefighter. Beyond basic training, he spent time abroad in combat environments such as Iraq and Afghanistan until 2009. It was that year an opportunity arose to play small roles in two comedies, ""All's Faire in Love"" and ""American Virgin"". Drawing from his idols of comedy, such as Seth MacFarlane and Dan Aykroyd, Donald was on his way to becoming a regular on the big screen. Those dreams however, had to be placed on hold as he returned to Afghanistan as a combat fireman up until 2014. No matter how much work was done abroad, the acting bug couldn't be shaken, thanks to inspiration from such greats as Vincent Price, Tim Burton, Kevin Smith and Stan Lee. Working with Producer/Director Joseph Kelly, Producer David Baily and his Publicist Angela Joseph, 2018 marked his return with the film ""Clown Motel: Spirits Arise"". Complete with his knowledge of combat and firefighting, and experience within nearly 3 dozen countries and islands around the world, Donald's future is as bright as his rekindled flame for the art.

She is a joyful young actress, whose happy demeanor continually shines. Lucy began performing professionally at the tender age of two, after a family friend introduced her family to a talent agent, who also quickly recognized her desire to perform, natural instincts and joyful personality. From early on, directors and coaches alike continually commented that Lucy had ""acting skills that could not be taught."" Lucy has since been blessed to work with a number of the industry's most prominent directors, including multiple Academy Award winning actors, in a variety of diverse and challenging roles.Some of Lucy's most prominent roles include: playing the daughter of Sam Worthington and Lily Rabe's characters in the Brad Anderson-directed Netflix film ""Fractured,"" portraying the younger version of Glenn Close's daughter in the upcoming Ron Howard film ""Hillbilly Elegy,"" co-starring opposite Catherine Zeta-Jones and Tom Ellis (playing his daughter in a recurring role) in the Facebook Watch series ""Queen America,"" playing young ""Janita Cooper"" (in another recurring role) in the upcoming National Geographic scripted television series, ""The Right Stuff"" (co-produced by Leonardo DiCaprio) and portraying little ""Colleen"" (also a recurring role) in the upcoming television series ""Preach"" (to be released in 2021).Miss Capri has also shared the stage with Broadway veterans in the 1st National Broadway Tour of the Tony-Nominated Musical ""Waitress,"" as ""Lulu"" (select engagements).

Together, they have over 200 voiceover credits to their names and regularly record from their professional home studio.Lucy's positive attitude goes hand-in-hand with a maturity that extends beyond her young years. Giving back is also important to Lucy and her family, and together they regularly volunteer with various special needs organizations, food pantries and animal shelters. Lucy wears her heart on her sleeve, and is always excited and thankful for each opportunity she is blessed with and considered for.Bubbly little Lucy Capri may be small and petite, but her joyful personality is bigger than life. Nicknamed ""Lulu,"" Lucy loves to perform, as well as play with her ""babies,"" kick goals with her soccer team, swim like a mermaid, rock out on her guitar or ukulele, and be a little chef in the kitchen with her mom, sister and great grandma.

Though his father was a native French speaker, in the home the family spoke only English and Stephen attended English speaking schools.After high school Stephen attended Acadia University in Wolfville, Nova Scotia and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts (Honors) with a major in history. He received his MA in history from the University of Western Ontario. He began a PH. D. course at the same school but after 18 months took a sabbatical to teach English in Seoul, Korea. The lure of steady employment and a chance to pay off student debts and travel made him give up his dreams to become a history professor. He spent the next 25 years working in the English education field in Korea, Russia, and for a short time back in Canada.In the late 1990s he began writing screenplays but found it difficult to penetrate the Hollywood system. He turned to writing education books and found steady work in that field. A chance meeting between one of his brothers and an old friend in Thailand led him to writing screenplays for a Thai production company in 2018. His first screen credit is a horror film called the 'Two of Us'.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0

nm1397313,The Beatles,The Beatles,,"The Beatles were an English rock band that became arguably the most successful act of the 20th century. They contributed to music, film, literature, art, and fashion, made a continuous impact on popular culture and the lifestyle of several generations. Their songs and images carrying powerful ideas of love, peace, help, and imagination evoked creativity and liberation that outperformed the rusty Soviet propaganda and contributed to breaking walls in the minds of millions, thus making impact on human history.In July of 1957, in Liverpool, Paul McCartney met John Lennon. Both were teenagers. Paul impressed John with his mastery of acoustic guitar, and was invited to join Lennon's group, The Quarrymen. George Harrison joined them in February of 1958. In 1959 they played regular gigs at a club called The Casbah. They were joined by vocalist Stuart Sutcliffe, and by drummer Peter Best, whose mother owned The Casbah club. Early incarnations of the band included The Quarrymen, Johnny & the Moon Dogs, and The Silver Beetles. John Lennon dreamed up the band's final name, The Beatles, a mix of beat with beetle. In 1960 The Beatles toured in Hamburg, Germany. There they were joined by Ringo Starr, who previously played with Rory Storm and the Hurricanes. In Hamburg, The Beatles made their first studio work as a backing band for singer Tony Sheridan's recordings for the German Polydor label, however, in the credits the band's name was changed to The Beat Brothers. From February 1961 to August 1963, The Beatles played a regular gig at the Cavern. They were paid five pounds for their first show, rising to three hundred pounds per show in 1963. In two and a half years The Beatles gave 262 shows at the Cavern in Liverpool.Brian Epstein was invited to be the manager of the Beatles in November 1961. His diplomatic way of dealing with the Beatles and with their previous manager resulted in a December 10, 1961, meeting, where it was decided that Epstein would manage the band. A 5-year management contract was signed by four members at then-drummer Pete Best's home on January 24, 1962. Epstein did not put his signature on it, giving the musicians the freedom of choice. At that time McCartney and Harrison were under 21, so the paper wasn't technically legal. None of them realized this and it did not matter to them. What mattered was their genuine trust in Epstein. He changed their early image for the good. Brian Epstein made them wear suits and ties, classic shoes, and newer haircuts. They were advised to update their manners on stage and quit eating and drinking in public. Brian Epstein worked hard on both the Beatles' image and public relations. He improved their image enough to make them accepted by the conservative media. Most if not all of their communication off-stage was managed by Brian Epstein.On January 1, 1962, The Beatles came to London and recorded fifteen songs at the Decca Records. They were not hired, but the material helped them later. During the year 1962, they made several trips to London and auditioned for various labels. In May of 1962 Epstein canceled the group's contract with Tony Sheridan and the German label. Brian Epstein was persistent in trying to sign a record deal for the Beatles, even after being rejected by every major record label in UK, like Columbia, Philips, Oriole, Decca, and Pye. Epstein transferred a demo tape to disc with HMV technician Jim Foy, who liked their song and referred it to Parlophone's George Martin. On June 6, 1962, at the Abbey Road studios, they passed Martin's audition with the exception of Pete Best. George Martin liked them, but recommended the change of a drummer. Being asked by John Lennon, Paul McCartney, and George Harrison; Epstein fired Pete Best. After a mutual decision the band was completed with Ringo Starr, who duly became the fourth Beatle. In September of 1962 The Beatles recorded their first hit Love Me Do, which charted in UK, and reached the top of the US singles chart.London became their new home since 1963. On February 11, 1963, The Beatles recorded the entire album 'Please, Please me' in one day, working non-stop during ten-hour studio session. In May and June, 1963, the band made a tour with Roy Orbison. In August of 1963, their single She Loves You became a super hit. Their October 1963 performance at the London Palladium made them famous in Great Britain and initiated the Beatlemania in the UK. The show at the London Palladium was broadcast live and seen by twelve million viewers. Then, in November 1962, The Beatles gave a charity concert at the Prince of Wales Theatre in London. There, performing for the rich and famous, John Lennon made his famous announcement: Would the people in the cheaper seats clap your hands? And the rest of you, if you'll just rattle your jewelry.In early performances the Beatles included popular songs from the 40s and 50s. They played rock-n-roll and R&B-based pop songs while they gradually worked on developing a style of their own. Their mixture of rock-n-roll, skiffle, blues, country, soul, and a simplified version of 1930s jazz resulted in several multi-genre and cross-style sounding songs. They admitted their interest in the music of Buddy Holly, Elvis Presley, Little Richard and other entertainers of the 40s, 50s and early 60s. Beatles' distinctive vocals were sometimes reminiscent of the Everly Brothers' tight harmonies. By 1965 their style absorbed ethnic music influences from India and other Oriental cultures, and later expanded into psychedelic experiments and classical-sounding compositions. Their creative search covered a range of styles from jazz and rock to a cosmopolitan cross-cultural and cross-genre compositions.Initially the Beatles were a guitars and drums band. In the course of their career every member became a multi-instrumentalist. George Harrison played the lead guitar and also introduced such exotic instruments as ukulele, Indian sitars, flutes, tabla, darbouka, and tampur drums. John Lennon played a variety of guitars, keyboards, harmonicas and horns. Paul McCartney played bass guitar, acoustic and electric guitars, piano and keyboards, as well as over 40 other musical instruments. The Beatles were the first popular band that used a classical touch of strings and keyboard instruments; their producer George Martin scored Baroque orchestrations in several songs, such as Yesterday, Eleanor Rigby, In My Life, and a full orchestra in Sgt. Pepper. John Lennon and Paul McCartney played piano in many of their songs. Their jamming on a piano together led to creation of their best-selling hit I Want to Hold Your Hand in 1963.At first the Beatles were rejected by Dick Clark after testing a recording of their song on his show. Then Brian Epstein approached Ed Sullivan, who discussed them with Walter Cronkite after seeing them on his CBS Evening News in 1963. Brian Epstein also managed to get their music played by influential radio stations in Washington and New York. The US consumer reaction was peaking, a single 'I Want to Hold Your Hand' was released in December 1963 by the Capitol Records. Their sensational tour in the USA began with three TV shows at the Ed Sullivan Theater in New York, in February of 1964. After that The Beatles endured several years of extremely intensive recording, filming, and touring. They stopped public performances after 1966, but continued their recording contracts. By 1985 The Beatles had sold over one billion records. Music became their ticket to ride around the world. Beatlemania never really ended since its initiation. It still lives as a movable feast in many hearts and minds, as a sweet memory of youth, when all you need is love and a little help from a friend to be happy.The Beatles' first two feature films, A Hard Day's Night (1964) and Help (1965), were made in collaboration with an American director, Richard Lester. Their humorous, ironic, and farcical film performances are reminiscent of the Marx Brothers' comedies. Later The Beatles moved into the area of psychedelic innovations with the animated film Yellow Submarine (1966). Their surrealistic TV movie The Magical Mystery Tour (1967) became the cause for the first major criticism of their work in the British press. Their film music was also released as studio albums. Original music by The Beatles as well as re-makes of their songs has been also used, often uncredited, in music scores of feature films and documentaries. Some of The Beatles concert and studio performances were filmed on several occasions and were later edited and released after the band's dissolution. In 1999 the remastered and remixed film The Beatles Yellow Submarine Adventure (2000) delighted a younger audience with incredible animation and songs.All four members were charismatic and individually talented artists, they sparked each other from the beginning. Eventually they made a much better group effort under the thorough management by Brian Epstein. His coaching helped consolidate their talents and mutual stimulation into beautiful teamwork. Paul McCartney had the privilege of a better musical education, having studied classical piano and guitar in his childhood. He progressed as a lead vocalist and multi-instrumentalist, as well as a singer-songwriter. McCartney wrote more songs for the Beatles than other members of the band. His songs Yesterday, Eleanor Rigby, Blackbird, When I'm 64, Let It Be are among the Beatles' best hits. Yesterday is considered the most-covered song in history with over three thousand versions of it recorded by various artists. McCartney accepted the agreement that was offered by John Lennon in 1957, about the 50/50 authorship of every song written by either one of them. Most of The Beatles' songs are formally credited to both names, regardless of the fact that many of the songs were written individually.On June 25, 1967, The Beatles made history becoming the first band globally transmitted on TV to an estimated 400 million people worldwide. The Beatles were a segment in the first-ever worldwide satellite hook-up and their new song ""All You Need Is Love"" was broadcast live during the show. Two months later The Beatles lost their creative manager Brian Epstein, whose talent for problem-solving was unmatched. ""That was it, the beginning of the end"", said Lennon. Evolution of each member's creativity and musicianship also led to individual career ambitions.John Lennon was experimenting with psychedelic poetry and art. His creativity was very unique and innovative. Lennon wrote Come Together, Girl, Revolution, Strawberry Fields and many other Beatles' hits. An out-of-context reprinting of Lennon's remarks on the Beatlemania phenomenon caused problems in the media. His comparison of Beatles' popularity to that of Jesus Christ was used to attack them publicly, causing cancellations of their performances and even burning of their records. Lennon had to apologize several times in press and on TV, including at a Chicago press conference. In 1967 John Lennon met Japanese artist Yoko Ono, whom he later married. George Harrison was the lead guitar player and also took sitar lessons from Ravi Shankar. Harrison had his own inner light of creativity and spirituality, he wrote Something, Taxman, I me mine, and other hits. Ringo Starr sang 'Yellow Submarine' and a few other songs. He has made a film career and also toured with his All Stars Band and released several solo albums. His 1973 release ""Ringo"" was the last album to feature all four living Beatles, although not on the same song.The Beatles created over 240 songs, they recorded many singles and albums, made films and TV shows. Thousands of memorable pictures popularized their image. In their evolution from beginners to the leaders of entertainment, they learned from many world cultures, absorbed from various styles, and created their own. Their cross-style compositions covered a range of influences from English folk ballads to Indian raga; absorbing from Johann Sebastian Bach, Ludwig van Beethoven, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Elvis Presley, Everly Brothers, Little Richard, and others. The songwriting and performing talents of Paul McCartney, John Lennon, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr, fused in the Beatles' music. Lennon and McCartney initiated changes in music publishing industry by breaking the Tin Pan Alley monopoly of songwriting. Their legacy became possible due to highly professional work by Brian Epstein and George Martin. In 1994 three surviving members reunited and produced Lennon's previously unknown song 'Free as a Bird'. It was preserved by Yoko Ono on a tape recording made by Lennon in 1977. The song was re-arranged and re-mixed with the voices of three surviving members. The Beatles Anthology TV documentary was watched by 420 million people in 1995.The Beatles represent the collective consciousness of several generations. Millions of viewers and listeners across the universe became conditioned to the sounds and images of The Beatles. Their influence on the modern world never stopped. Numbers may only show the tip of the iceberg (record sales, shows admissions, top hits, etc.). As image-makers and role models they pushed boundaries in lifestyle and business, affecting customers behavior and consumption beyond the entertainment industry by turning all life into entertainment. A brilliant blend of music and lyrics in their songs made influence on many minds by carrying messages like: give peace a chance and people working it out. A message more powerful than political control, it broke through second and third world censorship and regulations and set many millions free.Steve Jobs, being a big fan of Paul McCartney and The Beatles, referred to them on many occasions and also was interviewed on a showing of a Paul McCartney concert. When asked about his business model, Steve Jobs replied: My model for business is The Beatles: They were four guys that kept each other's negative tendencies in check; they balanced each other. And the total was greater than the sum of the parts. Great things in business are never done by one person, they are done by a team of people.The Beatles made impact on human history, because their influence has been liberating for generations of nowhere men living in misery beyond the Iron Curtain. Something in their songs and images appealed to everybody who wanted to become free as a bird. Their songs carrying powerful ideas of real love, peace, help, and imagination evoked creativity that outperformed the rusty Soviet propaganda and contributed to breaking chains and walls in the minds of millions. The Beatles expressed themselves in beautiful and liberating words of love, happiness, freedom, and revolution, and carried those messages to people across the universe. Their songs and images helped many freedom-loving people to come together for revolutions in Prague and Warsaw, Beijing and Bucharest, Berlin and Moscow. The Beatles has been an inspiration for those who take the long and winding road to freedom.Even after The Beatles had gone, the individual members continued to spread their message; from the concert for Bangladesh by George Harrison and Ringo Starr in 1971, to 2003 ""Back in USSR"" concert by Paul McCartney on the Red Square in Moscow, and his 2004 show near the Tsar's Winter Palace in St. Petersburg where the Communist Revolution took place, just imagine.In 2005 the Entertainment magazine poll named The Beatles the most iconic entertainers of the 20th Century. In July of 2006, the guitar on which Paul McCartney played his first chords and impressed John Lennon, was sold at an auction for over $600,000.In July 2012, Paul McCartney rocked the opening ceremony of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. He delivered a live performance of The Beatles's timeless hit ""Hey Jude"" and engaged the crowd of people from all over the world to join his band in a sing along finale. The show was seen by a live audience of 80000 people at the Olympic Park Stadium in addition to an estimated TV audience of two billion people worldwide.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0

It is there that he used the opportunity to not become a part of an already established system, but instead to observe the business from the inside. He regularly picked the brain of executive producer Ted Kotcheff, whom Princeton considers a mentor. He learned how to turn out multiple projects in a short amount of time. Taking notes, Princeton was determined to use this method and apply it to independent filmmaking.Princeton began building a catalog of niche-specific, critically acclaimed, ultra low budget feature films. Those films include Brian Ackley's critically acclaimed debut feature film Uptown, which has won awards and also secured a distribution deal, and The 10 Commandments of Chloe, his second feature as a director, which has won 9 awards and is being released nationwide.

He's known for his musical shape-shifting, evocative sense of melody, and distinctive vocals. Writing and performing his first songs at the age of 6 and beginning piano training shortly thereafter Detar became a full-time professional at 19 joining the seminal hardcore-metal band Zao as guitarist, bassist, & songwriter. Simultaneously he founded indie-alt-emo-rock pioneers The Juliana Theory where he handled lead vocals, keys, programming, guitar, songwriting, and eventually recording duties. Over their 10 year campaign Juliana Theory was notorious for an ever-evolving sound that ranged from post-punk and power pop to brushes with electronica and arena rock. Led by Detar they released 4 records and various EP's on major and indie labels touring the world constantly while selling over half a million albums. After The 'Theory disbanded Brett made a dramatic musical transformation releasing his first solo album steeped in lyrical and authentic classic country roots music - the critically acclaimed ""Bird In The Tangle."" Simultaneously he created the dark and brooding electronic film score for his first major motion picture - Paramount's #1 box office smash ""The Devil Inside."" He followed these up with his second solo album ""Too Free To Live"" which expanded on the haunting Americana sound of his first record, along with creating all of the industrial-orchestral & ambient music for Universal's action-thriller ""Wer"". Recently Detar's solo material has racked up placements on network and cable television shows and various ad campaigns. He's been known to moonlight as a producer and pop songwriter for other artists with major label cuts as a writer. When he can find the time he still enjoys hitting the road - having completed a number of US tours as a solo artist in the past couple years.","April 30, 1978 in Greensburg, Pennsylvania, USA",1978-04-30,"Greensburg, Pennsylvania, USA",,,,,,0,0,0,0

Born to Jean Barbot, squire, lord of Romagné and Mothais, councilor of the King at the Presidial of La Rochelle, and of Dame Suzanne Allaire, her original name was Gabrielle-Suzanne Barbot, lady of Romagné and Mothais. Barbot was born and died in Paris, France, but belonged to a powerful Protestant family from La Rochelle. In 1706, Barbot married Jean-Baptiste Gaalon de Barzay, knight, lord of Villeneuve, a member of an aristocratic family from Poitou and lieutenant-colonel of infantry at the Berville Regiment. Gabrielle-Suzanne became a widow at the age of 26 and progressively lost her family fortune and was forced to seek a means of employment to support herself.Eventually, she made her way to Paris where she embarked on her literary career. There, she met Prosper Jolyot de Crébillon, or Crébillon, père, whom she lived with until her death.Her tale, Beauty and the Beast was published in La Jeune Américaine, et les Contes marins in 1740. Barbot de Villeneuve may have heard this tale from a maid while she was traveling to America. After her death, Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont re-wrote the tale in an abridged form and published it in 1756 in her Magasin des enfants to teach young English girls a moral lesson. Beaumont's edition is more well-known than this original version. In fact, Barbot de Villeneuve was not credited in Leprince de Beaumont's publication.","November 28, 1685 in Paris, France",1685-11-28,"Paris, France","December 29, 1755 in Paris, France  (undisclosed)",1755-12-29,"Paris, France  ",undisclosed,Jean Baptiste de Gaalon de Villeneuve  (9 February 1706 - 8 November 1711) (his death) (1 child),1,0,1,1

nm3349155,Yuki Hayashi,Yuki Hayashi,,"Originally training as a rhythmic gymnast, Yuki Hayashi was never really interested in music. He became annoyed that the tracks he was selecting didn't suit his performance, as the arranger had no experience in gymnastics, it was difficult to convey his image. So, he decided to create his own accompaniments, and went to Akihabara to buy software that could compose music with just a computer. With no experience in music, the basis for his knowledge was how sounds resonated with his movement, and the image he had in mind. He also read books, and researched about sound frequencies and their relation to endorphins and dopamine. He made a rule to copy at least one song a day, and mix it to produce the ""sound image"" he wanted. It was something that eventually evolved into him being able to create his own original work. While teaching himself more in the realms of music theory, Hayashi realized how limited his options were to become a professional rhythmic gymnast. He decided that he would start to create accompaniments for other gymnasts, and started his career as a rhythmic gymnastics music composer. Being one of the only composers with actual athletic experience, he was able to paint other gymnasts images and transform them into music. He became the go-to guy that people went to for their accompaniments. As a college student, he needed to find a way to make money, and so he charged ¥5,000 per piece. After graduation, former gymnast, DJ, and one of the most prolific electronic music producers in Japan, Hideo Kobayashi, took him in as his apprentice. This was Hayashi's opportunity to learn more about how to create music professionally. While studying under Kobayashi, he was taught a variety of things, and was able to refine his already acquired skills, while also adding more to his expertise (dance music, beatmaking, etc). He officially began composing music for athletic competitions such as dancesport, gymnastics, figure skating, etc. Hayashi realized how passionate he was for music, and wanted to challenge himself more, to broaden his horizons. In 2009, he sent a demo song to a record company called Legendoor. Hiroyuki Sawano, the head member, listened to it and was so impressed that he invited Hayashi to collaborate with him on an upcoming drama he was going to be working on called Triangle. This was his big break. Soon after, Hayashi joined the agency, giving him the chance to create even more music. Yuki Hayashi now handles scores for TV drama, anime, and films.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0

nm3359985,Andrey Ivchenko,Andrey Ivchenko,191,"Born in the heart of the Ukraine, in a city called Kharkov, Andrey Ivchenko was always a dreamer and very passionate about television and film. As his desire to be an actor grew, Andrey enrolled in his high school theater programs and realized he was a natural at memorizing lines quickly and learned how to own the stage.At the age of 18, Andrey joined the U.S.S.R. military and served for 2 years. After he got out, he attended college and got his Masters Degree in Kinesiology. During that time, all he could think about was having an acting career. Knowing his opportunities to succeed in film and television were extremely limited in the Ukraine, Andrey packed up and moved to Europe for the next few years hoping to find bigger opportunities. Not too long after, he moved to Toronto, Canada (where he later became a citizen) to try his luck knowing there were many more productions in television and film casting. Almost immediately, Andrey signed with an agent and began landing acting/stunt roles on such known shows as: ""Falling Skies,"" ""Nikita,"" and ""The Transporter"" (the TV series). He landed his first leading role in a Lionsgate feature called ""The Way Of The West"" which was released in 2011 as well as a lead role in the Envision Media feature ""Freezer"" opposite Dylan McDermot which was released in 2014.After having some great success in Canada, Andrey decided to make the move to Los Angeles. Since moving to LA about 7 years ago, Andrey has landed almost a dozen additional recognizable credits in television and film. He is most recognized as the Russian Terminator, Grigori, on season 3 of the Netflix mega hit series ""Stranger Things"" as well as from his supporting role, opposite Vin Diesel, in the box office hit ""xXx: The Return Of Xander Cage"" as the Russian villain 'Red Erik.' Last year, Andrey also could be seen recurring on the TV show ""Counterpart"" on Starz!Andrey has definitely become a recognizable face and name within the entertainment industry and this next year will be very exciting with all of the upcoming projects he has in the works. In his spare time he likes to hang out with friends, go to the gym, and travel.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0

The final film, directed by Denis Villeneuve and starring Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal, was released in 2013, almost Four years after Guzikowski had completed the script.Guzikowski's next project was an adaptation of the 2008 Icelandic film Reykjavík-Rotterdam, titled Contraband.

nm3365402,Justin Marshall Elias,Justin Marshall Elias,,"Justin Marshall Elias is an actor and composer based in Hollywood, California. As an actor, Elias has performed in feature and short films, commercials, webisodes,and has received critical acclaim for his work on stage. An award-winning composer, Elias has created music and provided sound design for feature and short films, documentaries, television commercials, and corporate multimedia projects as well as releasing several ambient music albums under the artist name ""Dendroid"".Elias was born in Palo Alto, California, and resided in nearby Fremont, California. His father was a manager for Hewlett-Packard in their printer division and his mother was a sign-language interpreter. At age eight, he relocated with his parents and older sister Jessica to Eagle, Idaho. An actor from the earliest age he can recall, Elias first made up an imaginary world called ""Forever Game"" and promised himself he'd never stop playing. He loved films, particularly the sci-fi genre, and loved to act out and improvise scenes as well as develop characters. This led to making experimental films in middle and high school, in which he also acted.Elias began exploring his interest in music while in middle school, bouncing around from instrument to instrument but never really settling on one. Starting around eighth grade, he became a self-labeled ""musicologist"" to gain an understanding and appreciation for all types of music. Elias' grandfather encouraged him to play an instrument, believing music was vital to a good life. He joined the marching band in high school playing the alto saxophone.Toward the end of high school, Elias began working with a digital audio workstation called FL Studio (formerly known as FruityLoops) that featured a graphical user interface based on a pattern-based music sequencer. By the time he was a senior in high school, Elias had technically mastered professional broadcasting and film making software and hardware. He was hired as a technical director by an audio visual and presentation technology services and solutions company, and managed workers more than twice his age. Elias considers Electronica his gateway into the world of music creation. He credits IDM (intelligent dance music) artist Aphex Twin for ""opening his ears up to a vast range of sounds."" Elias credits as early influences in music composition a number of bands, artists, and composers including Woven, Plaid, Squarepusher, The Prodigy, Moby and Brian Eno.After graduating high school, Elias began his undergraduate study at Boise State University. His ongoing fascination of movies led him to transfer his sophomore year to Montana State University, ranked in the top five film schools in the nation to pursue filmmaking. Elias made the competitive film gate his Freshman year, one of 40 students accepted out of 300 applicants. While working on films in college, he continued to find himself pulled towards a single element in film, sound. He consistently received accolades for his sound design and music choices. While at MSU, Elias scored many student films, and garnered several awards and nominations for film composition and sound design. During his senior year Elias scored four short and feature films, including composing the original score for the short film ""Water's Handle Music"" which won the Medallion Award at the 2009 Washougal International Film Festival. During an awards ceremony, a casting director in attendance approached him and said, ""go to LA and be an actor, you can do it!""After graduating MSU, he briefly returned to Idaho and was cast as ""Garry Lejeune"" in the play ""Noises Off"" at the StageCoach Theatre for which he won the 2011 Masque Award for Best Actor. During the play's run he was cast for two television commercials. Elias reflected on the previous advice of the casting director as well as that of composer George S. Clinton who both urged Elias to relocate to Los Angeles. Upon arriving in LA in 2010, Elias continued to pursue his dual-track goals of composing and acting and also began working on the production side of the industry for production companies including the Syfy Channel, Jim Henson and the Food Network.Having become established at creating emotionally engaging film scores, Elias has garnered the attention of producers and directors and become a sought-after composer exhibiting a wide stylistic range and command of electronic composition. Adding to his appeal is Elias' ability to work in creative partnership with a film's director when composing to picture.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0

The cast of ""Solid State"" included Debbie Rochon, Suzi Lorraine and the star Vivica A. Fox (Independence Day/ Kill Bill vol.1). In 2011 his feature/TV film ""Kingdom of Gladiators"" won an Excellence Award at the Indie Film Fest in La Jolla. It's again a visual feast of stunning, intriguing locations, with gladiatorial fights to the bitter end marking the destiny of a kingdom. Right from the start of his career his work was appreciated and seen throughout major international festivals, not only at Cannes, but also at Dragon*Con Independent Film Festival. His first feature film ""Armaghedon"" (1993) was distributed in home video, Followed by a period of short film releases. 2001 saw the release of ""La Via Della Gloria"" (The Road of Glory), which was selected for the Donatello David Award and Golden Ciak, the major awards in Italy. His next feature ""Shan - The Ancient Heart of Natural People"" was produced with support from the United Nations, and screened at the UN Headquarters in New York during the Permanent Forum of Indigenous People.

Born in London as Bradley Heath Moore to his mother, Brenda Moore, who was from Jewish-Italian decent and his father, Ronnie, who he fondly describes as a 'chancer' from the East End of London. Brad grew up in North/East London before moving to Hertfordshire aged 11. He attended Chauncy Secondary School, Ware and later Shephallbury Art College, Stevenage. As a boy Brad boxed for Ware Boys Club under Taffy Green and later coached for several years at Hoddesdon Boxing Academy. He was introduced to acting at a very young age, which he credits to actress and neighbour Pauline Quirk, although he did not pursue a career until much later in life when he was 40. Brad initially performed for two years on the UK stand-up comedy circuit and during this time secured parts in over twenty low budget short films. This period he considers to be his training ground as a performer. Since then Brad has secured roles in many feature films starting with a small role in 'Best Laid Plans' alongside Stephen Graham, a cameo in the BAFTA winning 'The Rise' performing with Timothy Spall, a starring role in 'Montana' alongside Ashley Walters, Lars Mikkelsen and Michelle Fairley. Brad's first lead role was performing alongside Stephen Berkoff and Bernard Hill as the psychopath Gary Little in North vs South. The performance was well received by many critics prompting The Scottish Herald to say ""absolutely incredible performance from Brad Moore"" Movie Ramblings to say ""Moore's performance is a barnstormer, chewing the scenery with such gusto, an avatar of pure chaos. Magnetic, chilling, funny and annoying, whenever the unpredictable Moore's onscreen, all you're watching is him."" Well respected film critics Hey You Guys commented ""Moore's performance perfectly encapsulates everything that is brutal about this piece, as a well-crafted antagonist. It's a stand-out performance, as Gary Little is a nasty piece of work, intimidating, barbaric and yet somewhat pathetic too"". Midlands Movies commented ""Brad Moore as Gary is a nasty piece of work but a joy to watch as he becomes unhinged"". His most recent roles were in short film 'Ruminate' starring with Rebecca Hall (Vicky Christina Barcelona), and as the lead antagonist DC Kieth Stringer in british comedy 'Golden Years' alongside Una Stubbs, Simon Callow, Alun Armstrong, Phil Davies and Sue Johnston. Brad second lead role in the boxing comedy Gloves Off (which he also co-wrote) and stars alongside Ricky Tomlinson, Alexei Sayle, Paul Barber, and Denise Van Outen. Prompted Jarred Bold of The Sun to write "" Similar in style to The Full Monty, the film fuses comedy, romance and pathos and is classic British cinema"" The Daily Star wrote "" A fine Independent Movie"" Britflicks to quote "" Brad Moore who co wrote the film with Nesbit plays the lead character wonderfully"" OC Movies wrote ""Gloves Off is a blast to watch, full of humour and perfect timing.Brad Moore obviously injected a lot of heart into the project and despite his important screen presence, Moore never over shadows"" Andy Blackshaw from Back to Basics commented ""Moore has created one of the most entertaining British films of the last few years and it definitely deserves its place alongside British greats"" According to Him wrote "" An all star cast and a great performance from Brad Moore. A film that is pure entertainment""",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0

Now 15 the young beauty has already developed into a 'seasoned actress' with skills well beyond her years.When Katelyn performed the role of the beloved Young Thalia in the feature 'Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters' (2013), Katelyn was playing a character that mirrored herself almost exactly. Confident, passionate, unstoppable, Katelyn throws herself into her characters with the same dedication she commits to her many competitive sports.Katelyn's film career began in 2009 when she performed the role of a child dying from heart failure in the feature film 'Damage' with Steve Austin. In only her second role, Katelyn was cast as the supporting lead as Dolph Lundgren's daughter in the feature 'The Killing Machine' (2010). Later that year Katelyn won roles in various television projects including the well-known series 'Supernatural' and in 'Life Unexpected' as the younger best friend of Britt Robertson ('Tomorrowland').Success continued for Katelyn when she was cast to play the extremely complex and challenging role of an Asperger's patient in the television film 'Normal' (2011) opposite Carrie-Anne Moss. For the role, Katelyn needed to convincingly portray her character's numerous afflictions which included both head and eye ticks as well as a hand-washing obsession while portraying her character's internal emotions and delivering her lines. The Asperger expert on set stated that there was nothing that she could teach the young actress that she wasn't already doing; Katelyn was only 11 years old.Another of her many characters was that as fan-favourite Rachel Stonelake in the Hallmark Television Series 'When Calls the Heart' (2014-2015). However, Katelyn's greatest dramatic work to-date has been her role as Charlotte in the feature film 'Charlotte's Song' (2015) in which she stars opposite Iwan Rheon ('Game of Thrones'). A dark homage to Hans Christian Anderson's 'Little Mermaid' set in the 1930s dustbowl, Katelyn's portrayal of the amphibious siren who falls prey to a nefarious benefactor (Rheon) is a clear sign of the many award-nominated star performances we will see from her throughout her career.Just 6 years after her first dramatic entry into the film and television industry, Katelyn has amassed over 20 film and television credits and has won numerous accolades for her performances including 2 Young Actor Awards (Hollywood), 4 Joey Awards (Canada), and her recent nomination for a Leo Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in 'Charlotte's Song'.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0

Every Sunday morning, while her family slept, she would scoot to the TV room with a big bowl of cereal in hand and watch the Classics. It was her dream to become a writer/movie-maker, but her engineer-father encouraged her to pursue science over the arts. So off she went to university to do just that! Having received a Bachelor of Science (Hon) in computer science from Queen's University in Kingston, most of her career was spent in the corporate world as a product manager and marketing director in telecommunications and finance. Throughout her professional life, however, her love for writing and story-telling had not waned. It wasn't until she earned an M.B.A. that she decided to trade in her IT books for Final Draft and pursue screenwriting full time. She co-founded Skyword Productions and Entertainment Inc. and co-wrote her first Romantic Comedy, Baked Alaska, which placed first in the best Original Comedy/Romantic Comedy of the American Accolades competition, followed by Heaven Scent, an original screenplay that was later purchased by Hallmark and renamed Love Blossoms, which aired as a Valentine's Day Hallmark feature in 2017. Along with co-author Julie Kim, Kariné was commissioned to write Joseph and Mary (starring Kevin Sorbo and directed by Roger Christian). This writing team also developed and published the Percy children's book series, including Percy and the Perpetual Ooze and Percy and the Perpetual Prezzies, available on Amazon and Chapters/Indigo. Kariné and Julie wrote, directed and produced The Banana Chronicles, a short film that was purchased by Ouat Media, for which Kariné also composed the original musical score. Now represented by Doreen Holmes at Integral Artists, Kariné continues to develop original ideas, enjoying the ups and downs of the exciting world of film, but with a heart fulfilled for having realized a childhood dream.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0

It was through Dr. Joseph Mingrone, at Bishop Ford High School, that Che was first introduced to the method of acting. Beginning with elements of the Strasberg technique, Che became fascinated with Constantin Stanislavski during his college years. Though, acting was not Che's first love. That was music.After two years at Rider University, Che dropped out to go on a rap tour. It would be a decade before he looked back. While shooting a music video in 2007, he became friends with the gaffer, who was attending NYU Tisch Film School at the time. Che was asked to play a small role in a student film and that was enough to put the bug back in him. In less than two years, he had written, directed and/or starred in several short films and was navigating the festival circuit.In 2009, Che got a part in the indie film, Breaking Up Is Hard To Do (2010) with Blue Lion Club Productions, which shot in Atlanta. Two years later, while he was back in Atlanta shooting another BLC Productions film, Probable Cause (2012), he was introduced to the producers of a dance themed reality show who hired him as a segment host & he moved down to Atlanta.Following his move, he made a quick cameo on an episode of Tyler Perry's House Of Payne (2012), worked with the rapper David Banner in the web series, Walking With Gods (2013), playing Banner's arch nemesis, The Grim Reaper aka Man In The White Mask. He followed that up with a supporting role in the indie feature First Impression (2014) alongside Lamman Rucker, Carl Anthony Payne II and Thomas Mikal Ford.

nm3410278,Darine Hamze,Darine Hamze,,"Darine Hamze is a serious professional Lebanese movie star famous in the Middle East for taking on diverse, daring and complex roles in cinema. She is an MA graduate in Art and Media Practice from London's University of Westminster- UK, and a BA in Drama (Theatre Acting and Directing) from The Institute of Fine Arts- Lebanese University. Darine was born in the mid of the civil war in Beirut and sent to a private boarding school Sabis- ISC in London (England) during the war. Darine is one of her generation's most talented professionals backed up with education and grace; facing controversy and harshness from the other side with a calm professional reaction always in the face of fanaticism or some Arabic conservatives, as well as accepting the other's point of view. She is an actress with something to say and is seen as a pillar of woman's rights and the freedom of speech. Credited as one of the best Arab actresses for taking on challenging and complex roles in different dialects and languages throughout the region, her film career began in 2009 starring in a big Iranian acclaimed feature film The Book of Law- Ketabe Ghanoon, co-starring legendary Iranian movie star Parviz Parastui and directed by Maziar Miri, in which Darine studied intensive Persian dialect for it. The film had some controversy at first for criticizing the way Islam was being practiced erroneously in certain societies in Iran but was later on accepted as a smart amusing self-critiquing social romantic comedy and was a big hit and has since become a cult- underground film. Darine's academic theatrical background and love of her craft pushes her into selecting, as much as potentially available, such extreme, emotionally intelligent characters with something more to say. Her love of transformation for each role defied her ambitious acting abilities in reincarnating roles that are dissimilar in form, context and even language. She has a compelling range of characters she has played over the years in the region between Iranian and Lebanese cinema with languages varying between Arabic, Persian, French and English; as well as Arabic TV Series in Lebanese, Egyptian and Syrian dialects. Her next unique role was in 2011's French/ Lebanese controversial film Beirut Hotel opposite French actor Charles Berling, directed by Danielle Arbid, which made a huge controversy because of its political sub-text and explicit scenes. Darine took on the challenge this time to portray (Zoha) a wild romantic alternative singer that falls in love with a French spy. Darine practiced her French and even took singing classes which made the film's soundtrack, with her voice, a hit. But the film was banned in Lebanon due to suggestive scenes depicting the Lebanese government as covering up some kind of information regarding the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Harriri. However, the film aired in France and Germany on Arte, and Darine was bombarded by opposing opinions for playing such a daring role. She was praised by the liberal audiences and out shun by conformists in a number of Arab societies, and she was banned by a local Islamic television, for playing the French audacious role while having being screened in their television series where she played a veiled woman (and consequently got replaced by another actress in their series' second season). In reply to the replacement the elegant actress stated calmly, that she is ""a professional actress whom has the right to play any character life can encompass, whether certain ideologies accept these characters or not, emphasizing that cinema is a reflection of real life and a mirror of society with all its hidden or public issues, characters, colors, shapes and sizes, and that it is part of her job to be able to bring all sorts of characters, from all aspects of society, to life. Ending the debate by saying that she accepts their decision and respects their religion's rules and taboos because she believes in freedom of speech and having different opinions; likewise having freedom to choose any role to play as well"". When asked if she regrets playing this character after losing a part of her audience, and facing harsh judgment and criticism, she explained that ""an actor's job is to play all kinds of characters in the best way possible, be them devils or saints and whether loved or hated in society, and to be judged on her acting ability alone. That she as an actress is neither the veiled Muslim woman nor the liberated audacious singer, but an agnostic actress in love with her craft, and that the region's society will eventually one day understand what artistic efforts she had performed playing such opposite characters faultlessly; and how in other artistically educated and advanced countries, she would have been sensibly praised for such character built acting abilities of opposing nature"". In 2016 Darine first came to the attention of the American audiences with her performance in the German/ Lebanese film Halal Love (and sex), directed by Assad Fouladkar and produced by Razor Films, which screened at the US film festivals Sundance and The Hamptons as well as many other international film festivals and screened the Golden Globes HFPA nominations. She depicted the dreamy role of (Loubna), a Muslim divorced woman trying to live her love live and desires without breaking any of her religions rules, and in it she took on the taboo topic of the Islamic pleasure marriage (which is a short-term contract). As Darine accepted an Award for it in Japan (Fukuoka International Film Festival 2016) she confirmed that she ""looks for roles that challenge her psychologically and mentally, as well as fill her human emotions to stimulate evolution, because film is also a window into other people's worlds, a small peak into the other's point of view, which can help wake up society's humanity and lend a hand in bring humans together. And that she hopes that with every character she plays she brings a voice to those hidden closed windows that can help unite races, religions and cultures through the common grounds of art"". She continues taking on challenging, politically unaccepted, out of the box roles in the region. Her new 2017 film role in NUTS, premiering in Dubai international Film Festival, will be (Lanna) a Lebanese poker addict rebel that dives into the risky underground world of gambling in Lebanon. Her character conveys the kind of unstable risky life one encounters while living in the Middle East.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0

His first artistic experiment was playing at Theater of elementary school that was preceded by some terrific memories of watching movies at a nearby Cinema, very close to his father's little sewing shop; at early high school years, he began to develop a passion towards painting which soon thoroughly overwhelmed him. He won three National Painting Competition successively in 1991, 1992 and 1993. Having been bewitched by art, he finally took a lifelong commitment and formally decided to devote his life and future to studying and practicing art; so he got his BA degree in Painting from Beaux Arts Faculty of Tehran University in 1997 and later on his MA degree in Animation Directing from Cinema & Theater Faculty of Art University in 2004. From 1994 to 1997 he had been thoroughly preoccupied by designing and illustration of children's books, graphics and interior designing of theaters and scenes.

nm3440852,Ram Khatabakhsh,Ram Khatabakhsh,,"British/ Persian composer Ram Khatabakhsh began his musical career at the age of 6 when he first started playing the keyboard. By the age of 11 was attending formal piano and music lessons and exploring different musical genres. Inspired by cinema and the musical scores from his favorite films, Ram began to compose seriously at the age of 15.In 2008, Ram achieved his Bachelor's degree in Music Composition (BMUS) at the respected Kingston University in London. During his time at BMUS he was selected to write an orchestral composition for a public performance at London's Southbank Centre, as well as being invited to the Royal College of Music's prestigious composer workshop as the sole representative for his university. Once there, he worked closely with the noted British conductor and film/television orchestrator, Christopher Austin ('Hyde Park on Hudson').On graduating, Ram began scoring for independent films, television and corporate projects. That same year he launched his own music production company, Motion Sound Production, so that he could offer a more coherent musical package to film and television directors, producers and corporate clients.In a short space of time, Ram has composed music for international award-winning feature films; short films, documentaries, animations and television talk shows; as well as commercials and corporate videos for prestigious companies such as Ford, Nestle, Rapha, ViiV Healthcare and Maersk Oil.In 2011 Ram scored 'The Fifth Horseman', which was nominated by EMMY in 2012 for the Best Drama, and the multi-award winning documentary 'Piracy: The Human Cost' and 'With Good Intentions' which he worked on with sound designer Glenn Freemantle (Gravity). In 2013 he was selected by 'The Mill' from dozens of composers to score a £2.3million corporate video for Riyadh Metro System and later that same year he was selected, out of thousands to attend the prestigious Berlinale Talents 2014 as part of Composers and Sound designer's selection.Ram's uniqueness is his varied musical style and his ability to effortlessly score a scene on the spot with orchestration. He has a rare sensitivity to the mood and an innate understanding of the type of music that will complement a scene without dominating it. Many entertainment industry professionals have labeled Ram as 'an exceptional talent' with a 'rare gift' and an 'extraordinary musical ear with originality'.The multi-lingual British composer credits his musical gift to his passion for his craft, his unique background merging British and Persian sensibilities, and a deep love and appreciation for filmmaking.","December 7, 1985",1985-12-07,,,,,,,0,0,0,0

Having over 30 European films under his belt, Alex also stars in the third and forth season of popular American series UnREAL on Lifetime Channel, and Netflix show Space Force on the side of Steve Carell and John Malkovich.The global rising star that is Alex Sparrow, is on a seemingly unstoppable trajectory of success and earth staggering talent.It's a a rare find in the entertainment business to see one individual not only engage in, but conquer, a plethora of fields - actor, director, screenwriter, recording artist, musician, composer, producer, arranger.Born in Russia and raised in the family of Austrian Baron Alexis von Gecmen-Waldek, Sparrow's early training included Moscow Jazz College, followed by Moscow Art Theatre Studio School (MHAT).Showing the young generation that a healthy lifestyle and positive mental attitude is a recipe for success, in 2007 Alex was appointed Good Will Ambassador to the United Nations for all Anti-AIDS Programs under jurisdiction of U.N.F.P.A.His dedication to his all round craft saw him add 'professional stuntman' to his name through his study at Mosfilm Studios. Already a multi-instrumentalist and skilled in dancing in a myriad of styles, Alex was committed to further development and excellence in the film world. In his new home of L.A, he completed both Anthony Meindl's Actor Workshop and studied at the Ivana Chubbuck Studio.Truckloads of natural ability fostered with endless hard work certainly paid off. Amongst some of his most impressive mainstream achievements, Sparrow's respective wins of ""X-factor', 'Dancing with the Stars', and twice Nickelodeon Kids Choice Awards as 'Favourite Actor' surely put him in a stand out category of his own.And if that wasn't enough, his music video ""She's Crazy But She's Mine"" (written, performed, directed and starring Alex himself) quickly going viral across the globe, now boasts more then 980 million views on Facebook, and 302 million plus on YouTube.Perhaps it's this gifted Eastern European's accomplishments in film that have earned him the most critical acclaim. A three-time 'Best Score Award' winner and several acting gongs, Alex composed the music for the European co-produced film ""The House of Others"", a multiple award winning post-war drama that was a Georgian Oscars and Golden Globe entry in 2017, also receiving the most prestigious US Spotlight Award and Satellite Award.Just beginning to take his first steps on the way to his International career he got into an accident, leaving the left side of his body paralyzed. During a year and a half of rehabilitation, he had to work hard to get his life back, and had to learn many things like singing from scratch again. While the doctors were saying that it's very unlikely he would ever be able to continue with acting and show business, Alex was trying to find a new place behind the camera as a director and screenwriter. In 2013, the moment he was able to work again, he made his first short movie, called ""DAD""- as screenwriter, director, editor and composer, and gets with it numerous Awards on International Film Festivals. Alex has made it - today he is back on stage, proving the doctors wrong. With that fierce imagination, anything-is-possible attitude and boundless capabilities to turn captivating ideas into reality on any medium, there's no telling what Alex Sparrow will do next.","January 19, 1988 in Tula, Tulskaya oblast, RSFSR, USSR [now Russia]",1988-01-19,"Tula, Tulskaya oblast, RSFSR, USSR [now Russia]",,,,,,0,0,0,0

nm3450601,Simon Horrocks,Simon Horrocks,,"Simon Horrocks was born in Palmers Green, North London, on July 11th, 1965. He is the son of Anthony Horrocks and Janet Youngs, who separated when he was 3 years old. He has one older brother, Nicolas Horrocks, and a younger half-brother, Nathan Horrocks.Simon Horrocks spent part of his early childhood raised on an art and crafts commune in Somerset. After his father watched Easy Rider in 1969, he left his job as a lecturer at Hornsey School of Art and led a group of artists to start an alternative life on a farmhouse converted into studios.Horrocks made his first films from the age of 8, shooting with a clockwork 8mm camera. At the age of 9, his father went to live in St Lucia and he moved back with his mother and stepfather, Iain Manson, attending St Dunstans Secondary School. At 13, the family moved back to North London, where Horrocks has lived since (apart from 2 years in Brighton, from 1988-1990).Doing a Foundation in Art & Design in 1983-84 at Middlesex University, he again worked on 8mm films, this time in collaboration with Jonathan Glazer (Sexy Beast, Under the Skin). He applied to do a degree in Fine Art Film at St Martin University, but when he failed to get a place he went on to start a career music.In 1991 he formed pop-dance duo Aquarius with his then life-partner, Sarah Jane Fogg. Their debut single ""Hey Babe"" was awarded Melody Maker ""Single of the Week"" in January, 1993, two weeks after their first son, Titus, was born. Completely self-promoted, the song was played on Radio 1, notably by legendary DJ John Peel.Although, the exposure would normally have resulted in the song making it into the UK charts, the record label (Solid Pleasure, owned by Yello's Dieter Meier) had failed to distribute the single to stores as they didn't believe the song would get any media attention, and the release was a commercial failure.Horrocks and Fogg went on to produce Tara Newley's debut album (unreleased) for Trevor Horn's ZTT label. From 1997, they worked for major publishing label Carlin Music, who were later bought by Warner Chappell.After splitting with Sarah Fogg in 2008, in 2009 Horrocks set out to make his debut feature, Third Contact. Shooting the film on consumer camcorder, without a crew and a budget of £4000, it took 3 years to complete.On Sept 2nd, 2013, Third Contact made cinema history by being the first self-funded micro-budget film to screen during peak time at London's BFI IMAX and the first full-length fiction film to premiere in-theatre and simultaneously broadcast live to over 20 countries with a follow up director's Q&A via twitter and Google hangout.Third Contact was shot on a consumer camcorder, without a professional crew, on a budget of £4000 and premiered at the prestigious Hof Film Festival in Germany. German press reviewed the film very favourably, with award-winning critic Thomas Rothschild hailing it as a ""masterpiece"" and comparing it to work by Evald Schorm and Ken Loach.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0

During a three-decade career in international business, Mimran honed his knack for numbers and impressive instincts that serve him well in the high-risk world of film production.David Mimran's production career began in the late 2000s, when he teamed up with former Geffen Records president Jordan Schur to launch a production company. In 2009, Mimran Schur Pictures was born.Mimran Schur Pictures has nearly a dozen titles to its credit. The first was Stone, a complex John Curran-directed psychological thriller starring Robert DeNiro, Milla Jovovich, and Edward Norton. Stone debuted to strong reviews at the 2010 Toronto Film Festival. Later that year, Overture Pictures acquired distribution rights and released the film in the United States.Mimran Schur Pictures followed up with Henry's Crime, a black comedy starring Keanu Reeves, Vera Farmiga, and James Caan. Malcolm Venville directed. After a successful showing at the Toronto Film Festival, Moving Pictures acquired and distributed the film.Henry's Crime was followed shortly by Warrior (2011), a star-studded character study centering on a family of desperate amateur cage fighters. Working alongside Tom Hardy and Jennifer Morrison, Nick Nolte earned an Oscar nod for his gripping portrayal of a former champion lost in the clutches of alcoholism and anomie. Co-financed by Lionsgate, Warrior was Mimran Schur's best-received production to date.In the years since, David Mimran and his production team have released an eclectic mix of films, some starring household names. Rapture-Palooza (2013), the company's lightest film to date, is a Craig Robinson-Anna Kendrick romp about two teens who find the fortitude to challenge the Antichrist. Pawn Shop Chronicles (2014), a dark comedy starring Matt Dillon, Brendan Fraser, and the late Paul Walker, is a tableau of alternately compelling and farcical tales, including one man's desperate search for his kidnapped wife and an Elvis impersonator's tragicomic (but mostly comic) story.Forthcoming Mimran Schur titles include The Kid, a Western starring Chris Pratt and Ethan Hawke; and One Nation Under God, a political thriller starring Casper Van Dien and Antonio Sabato Jr.David Mimran balances his executive production duties at Mimran Schur Pictures with a slew of other obligations. He's on the board of trustees of New York City's Mount Sinai Hospital and a governor of the Peres Center for Peace, which works to achieve peace in the Levant and the wider Middle East. Mimran also sits on the board of Artists for Peace and Justice, a global organization that uses the power of celebrity to advocate for equity and nonviolence.

nm3557613,Karan Brar,Karan Brar,165,"Best known for his role as 'Ravi Ross' on Disney Channel's hit series ""Jessie"" and its spinoff, ""Bunk'd,"" Karan Brar is taking Hollywood by storm and seeking to break cultural barriers in the entertainment industry. He stars in ""Bunk'd"" on Disney Channel and 2018 will be a major year for Karan as he breaks out of his Disney roles for some exciting new projects including the Legendary Entertainment/Universal Pictures film ""Pacific Rim: Uprising"" and the YouTube Red teen dramedy series, ""Youth and Consequences.""""Pacific Rim: Uprising"" is a science-fiction monster film produced by Guillermo del Torro. The film is a sequel to the 2013 film ""Pacific Rim"" and also stars John Boyega, Scott Eastwood, and Jing Tian. Karan plays 'Suresh,' a new cadet for the Jaeger pilot program. To prepare for the role, Brar worked out with a personal trainer for several months both before and during shooting of the film, which included stunt and fight training as well as a monitored diet. The film is set to be released early 2018.Born and raised in Bothell, Washington, Karan pursued various sports to try to break out of his shell and find his 'niche'. He soon realized sports were not going to be his calling in life, and his father, who had done theater in India, suggested that he try acting. After a few workshops and acting classes, Karan discovered he was far more talented and comfortable on stage than he was on the field. So, at the age of eight, he signed with an agent and quickly booked his first commercial.Not long after, Karan's big break came when he landed the role of 'Chirag Gupta' in Twentieth Century Fox's hit trilogy based on the New York Times best-selling book series, ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid."" The films included: ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"" [2010], ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules"" [2011] and ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days"" [2012]. However, it is Karan's role as 'Ravi' on ""Jessie"" that truly put Karan on the map. In ""Jessie,"" Ravi was a recent immigrant to the United States who was struggling to adapt to his new surroundings, while still trying to hold on to his Indian culture and religious beliefs. Since then, Ravi has adjusted and come into his own, bringing his considerate and sometimes naïve but hilarious personality to life in ""Bunk'd.""With Karan's family originally being from Punjab, India, he understands the importance and responsibility of portraying the Disney Channel's first-ever series regular Indian character. Brar has helped the channel diversify culturally, while sharing his native Indian culture with its target audience of kids and families. On the other hand, as a first-generation Indian-American, Karan also feels strongly that it is his duty to show his fans and the entertainment industry that he is more than the cliché ""Indian character,"" and he has something much greater to offer.Karan has several other projects under his belt as well, including NBC's ""The Night Shift"" where he played a young Afghan drug dealer, the Disney Channel Original Movie, ""Invisible Sister"" and guest-star appearances on several Disney Channel shows. Brar also voiced the character of 'Mason' in Twentieth Century Fox's ""Mr. Peabody & Sherman"" and 'Prince Zandar' in Disney's ""Sophia the First.""When he is not busy lighting up the big or small screens, Karan enjoys quality time with his friends doing anything that can get them outdoors, from beach trips to hiking and travel adventures. He also spends time working on his photography and videography techniques. Karan enjoys playing video games and discovering new music as well. His philanthropic efforts include lending his voice as a celebrity ambassador for Thirst Project, the world's largest youth water organization whose goal is to build a socially-conscious generation that will end the global water crisis. Brar also has a passion for helping those affected by or who have loved ones affected by mental illness. He hopes to help remove the stigma around the topic and let others know it is something that is okay to discuss. Karan currently resides in Los Angeles.","January 18, 1999 in Redmond, Washington, USA",1999-01-18,"Redmond, Washington, USA",,,,,,0,0,0,0

He lived and went to school in Minnesota and Wisconsin, and earned his Bachelor of the Arts at Luther College in Iowa. Though he finds his roots in the Midwest, Xander's life has branched out around the world. Xander has spent time in Greece, Italy, Canada, Mexico, France, England, and lived for one year in Nagasaki, Japan. He now lives in Hollywood, California.Xander's first exposure to the stage was at a very young age, with involvement in his elementary school and community plays. He continued to be heavily involved in both, and was eventually able to perform in many diverse roles. From Annie's Daddy Warbucks to Grease's Danny Zuko, Xander was able to give stellar performances as both an actor and vocalist. At Luther College, Xander was better able to hone his acting skills, and participated in many original, collaborative, and classic performances. Xander flexed his abilities in Noises Off, Big Love, Beyond Therapy, Hair, and Square Stories, as well as explored movement in Portals and So Tech, So Savvy. Aside from performing on stage, Xander also participated behind the scenes, as a director and designer for both ""Art"" and Kabuki Lady MacBeth. Xander majored in Theatre/Dance, and minored in Art and International Studies, with training in Costume and Makeup Design as well as Acting, Dance, Directing, and Choreography. Xander participated in private vocal lessons and choirs for many years throughout High School and College. He has had radio voice-over training, and was a DJ for Luther's radio station, KWLC. From 2007 to 2008 Xander lived in Nagasaki, Japan. He attended the Nagasaki University of Foreign Languages and majored in Japanese through a one-year program. Xander still has a solid hold of the Japanese language, and is excited at any opportunity to use it. While in Nagasaki, Xander was a member of the Toppuu Yosakoi club, a dance program that permanently changed his dance and choreographic style. Xander brought the yosakoi style of dance back to Luther College, and started a successful dance group that performed throughout the year, including an invited performance at the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize Forum. With an interest in technology given to him from his late father, Xander plunged into the fascinating world of graphic design during his time at Luther.

His third feature, Black Eve (released 2013), while an homage to early 80's slasher films, has an art house feel to the structure of story showing a disjointed timeline that fits together the horrific events of a Halloween party gone bad after an uninvited guest shows up and starts killing people off one by one.Andrews followed up Black Eve with his dramatic zombie film Sick (release January 6th 2015). With countless zombie films being made every year, Andrews decided to focus on an aspect of the zombie apocalypse rarely ever seen in horror films. Sick examines the bleak loneliness of surviving day to day in such a horrific world. But while the film encompasses an overwhelming sadness as it studies humanity and human interaction, it never skimps on the horror.In 2014, Andrews went to camera on two more horror features. Save Yourself and Desolation. His films are always different in subject matter, but one thing Andrews' promises about his horror is that they will always be artful in their approach.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0

He enrolled for a Visual Communications course at the Loyola College, Chennai, but dropped out shortly after to make films. Kumararaja cited that it was composer Ilaiyaraaja's music that animated him to come to films and to study Visual Communications in the first place. However, he discontinued his studies in 1998 and started to work as a freelance copywriter and photographer for a while. He went on to shoot advertisement films and also directed a five-part documentary on South Indian Temples, Sthala Puranam for Vijay TV. In 2005, he participated at the one-minute film competition 60 Seconds to Fame by Ability Foundation, aiming for the prize money. His short film Becky was awarded the first prize at the AbilityFest2005. Kumararaja then collaborated with Pushkar-Gayathri, writing the dialogue of their directorial debut Oram Po (2007). He would later write all songs for their second project Va (2010) as well. Through Pushkar-Gayathri, Kumararaja met S. P. B. Charan, who agreed to produce his first feature film Aaranya Kaandam.Kumararaja began writing his maiden film in December 2006. Although he had wanted to make a ""racy film"" - he wrote the climax part first, before going on to add multiple story lines - he said that the film had eventually turned out to be a ""leisurely paced film, taking its own time to unfold"". Kumararaja met Charan in January 2007 and narrated him the script for two hours. Filming was supposed to commence by late 2007, but Charan opted to produce another film first. Aaranya Kaandam was launched in December 2008, with Bollywood actor Jackie Shroff, who was being introducing to Tamil films, Ravi Krishna and Sampath Raj in the lead roles. Kumararaja took more than one and a half years to complete the film, which was entirely shot in and around Chennai. Upon completion, the film ran into trouble when the regional censor board in Chennai refused to clear it, demanding 52 cuts due to profanity and excessive violence. Kumararaja expressed that he made the film for a matured audience and not for children, while adding that he expected difficulties in the censorship. Since he wanted to present the film uncompromisingly to the audiences, he and Charan approached the Central Tribunal at Delhi, that cleared the film. Dubbed as the first neo-noir film in Tamil cinema, Aaranya Kaandam opened to strong critical acclaim, winning the Grand Jury Award for Best Film at the 2010 South Asian International Film Festival, and two prizes at the 59th National Film Awards, including the Indira Gandhi Award for Best First Film of a Director for Kumararaja.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0

She is a director of great sensitivity and a screenwriter of enormous talent and accomplishment. I have been collaborating with her on television and feature film projects for the past two years and she has brought great depth and passion to every element of our work. She is a true professional with a European sophistication rarely seen in Australian productions but which adds a new and vital dimension to her work. I thoroughly recommend her for whatever position she seeks. She is an enormous asset to our industry.Canberra, 14/10/2017Donald Crombie - Former Directing Lecturer, IFSS, Sydney, Former Head of Directing, Australian Film, Television Radio School, Sydney doncrom@zip.com.auTo whom it may concern:I tutored Zdenka Simandlova in the craft of direction at the International Film School of Sydney. Ms Simandlova was an outstanding student with a mature aesthetic and a strong understanding of the art of translating a story from page to screen.Zdenka impressed me in particular with her ability to create mood, atmosphere and tension on screen as evidenced in her excellent short film, Defect. In that film, she created 1950s Prague most believably, a considerable challenge considering it was filmed in inner Sydney, Australia with a student film budget. That film shows that Zdenka Simandlova is a film director.She satisfied me in all aspects of her craft: preparation, storyboard to screen and post- production. She is a very good communicator and was respected by her key creative crew. She is able to give direction to actors in a manner that earns their trust and I was impressed by her approach to working with actors and the performances they achieved under her guidance. Her short film work demonstrates that Zdenka Simandlova is capable and ready to move to longer form filmed drama and I commend her to producers and funding organisations.Sydney, 12/11/2016Contact - Zdenka Simandlova: Mobile +61 487 726 881 Home +61 2 4457 2636 twinscreenplays@gmail.com",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0

At the age of 22, Andrew produced the 2012 Academy Award®-winning short film Curfew, likely making him the youngest person to ever produce an Oscar winning film... probably. He directed the feature documentary Mad as Hell (Hot Docs 2014 Winner Conscious Media Award), the award-winning narrative short Grandma's Not A Toaster (Tribeca 2013) and the feature documentary Mary and Bill (Wisconsin Film Festival 2011 Winner Best Documentary). In 2017 Andrew was the editor and executive producer of Active Measures, an acclaimed documentary about Russian interference in the 2016 election. To rebound from such depressing subject matter, Andrew co-wrote, produced, edited, and was the 2nd unit director of a short comedy film called An Orgy in Joshua Tree. It was directed by and stars actor Josh Zuckerman, a good friend and frequent collaborator. Andrew's screenplay adaptation of Dogtooth, a remake of Yorgos Lanthimos' (director of The Favourite) Academy Award®-nominated Greek foreign film of the same name, was optioned by the studio Mandalay Pictures. While his whereabouts are unknown, word is that Andrew is currently directing a feature documentary and writing a feature screenplay which he will also direct.Andrew has been making films since he was eight years old - from fictional action films about Al Capone, to documentaries about Native American burial effigy mounds. Telling stories has always been his passion. After moving to LA, Andrew was first hired by the online news show The Young Turks. As one of their earliest directors and producers, he was essential in helping build the company into a massive success on YouTube, reaching billions of views. During his tenure at The Young Turks, Andrew co-created What The Flick!?, a popular online film review show. He followed and filmed Cenk Uygur (host and founder of The Young Turks) as he transcended from a YouTube sensation to a national television host on MSNBC and Current TV. This footage was later used for the film Mad as Hell which Andrew independently directed, produced, and edited after he left the company. Oscilloscope Laboratories (a film distribution company founded by 'Beastie Boys' member Adam Yauch) released Mad As Hell both theatrically and on all digital and VOD platforms on Feb 6th, 2015. Andrew's short film Grandma's Not A Toaster premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival and became a 'Staff Pick' on Vimeo where it has reached a wide audience. It was distributed by Robert De Niro's studio TriBeCa Productions playing globally on United Airlines.While his true calling is directing, Andrew has had a prolific career as a producer and editor of both documentary and narrative films. He produced and edited the feature documentaries; The Past is a Grotesque Animal (Sundance Now Doc Club 2014), about the band 'of Montreal' and frontman Kevin Barnes, and Bounce: How the Ball Taught the World to Play (SXSW 2015). Andrew was the editor and executive producer of the award-winning art house film Wasted Beauty, produced by Eva Longoria. He co-produced the feature romantic comedy Lust For Love (2014) starring Fran Kranz and Dichen Lachman. He was the executive producer of the popular documentary The Culture High, the drama A Real Adventure starring Josh Zuckerman, and the dark comedies The Lord of Catan starring Amy Acker, and Limbo starring H. Jon Benjamin and Natasha Leggero. Andrew was an editor of the feature dramas: Before I Disappear (SXSW 2014 Audience Award Winner, IFC Films) and Sidney Hall (Sundance Film Festival 2017, A24), for which he also served as an associate producer. He edited two episodes for First Look Media's (Spotlight) documentary series Primaries, about the 2016 election, which aired on Fusion TV. Andrew is managed by the legendary Ellen Goldsmith-Vein at The Gotham Group.Along with his passion for welding and painting, Andrew enjoys mountaineering, wine, sci-fi novels, not using Snapchat, wine, saving the world from Artificial Intelligence on a daily basis, and wine.If you are interested in purchasing an ""original Napier"" sculpture or painting, email us or please click here.

Even at an early age, they devoured Stephen King novels, one after another as fast as they could read - and would sneak into the over 18 sections at video stores, to critique the bloody images on the backs VHS horror movies and in gore magazines.They both entered the film industry, acting and doing background work - and were soon unsatisfied with stereotypical roles that were commonly offered to identical twins. To expand their horizons, they trained in martial arts in hopes of picking up stunt roles and briefly attended a film school that included an intensive stunt program. For one of the school's final film projects, their prepared short film had its funding misappropriated and their short was pulled from the program. Undeterred, they decided to go ahead with it anyway, getting a new cast and crew and paying for it out of their own pockets. The title of that project was 'Dead Hooker In A Trunk'.'Dead Hooker In A Trunk' is their debut film, which the twins wrote, directed, produced, starred in, and preformed the stunts. Using Robert Rodriguez's book, Rebel Without A Crew - a bible for how film-making could be done on a modest budget, armed only with creativity and ambition. Even following the spirit of El Mariachi, the twins' story reached the original El Mariachi, actor Carlos Gallardo - who not only gave the ladies advice, but appeared in the film - as God. The completed film - embraced by horror fans, film festivals, and critics - became an underground sensation, called ""a hidden gem in indie film-making"" and ""a cult classic in the waiting"", and won multiple awards: Pollygrind's Favorite Feature, Best Screenplay, City of Death's Best Director Award, and Cinefantasy's Audience Favorite Prize.In 2008 the twins incorporated, Twisted Twins Productions -- to create their own label for many future projects to come, including their highly anticipated second feature, American Mary, an analogy of their own struggles in the film industry. American Mary has gone on to win numerous praise and awards. The film has gone on to become a cult classic and the various costumes of the lead character Mary Mason a Halloween and horror convention favorite for cos-players.The Soska Sisters have gone on to be very outspoken about equal rights across the board including but not limited to gender equality and equal rights for the LGBT community. They're actively involved in promoting blood donation and create a new PSA for it every February. And they are only just getting started.2014 was a big year with the Soska Sisters bringing a new life to See No Evil 2 where they resurrect the WWE Studios franchise with WWE Superstar Glenn ""Kane"" Jacobs reprising his role as Jacob Goodnight and scream queens Danielle Harris and Katharine Isabelle appear together for the first time. As well, the Twins will be one of the all star director lined up for ABCs of Death 2 in a segment that will shock and be destined for cult status. Their segment, T is for Torture Porn, has since been banned in Germany.In 2015, the twins did a genre jump, teaming again with Lionsgate and WWE Studios, with a action revenge thriller called Vendetta to star, Dean Cain, Paul 'Big Show' Wight, and Michael Eklund. The high action, ultra gory nature of the film proved that the sisters are not one trick ponies as they expand their sensibilities to this Justin Shady written, men's prison revenge flick.Avid comic book fans, the Soska Sisters have teamed up with Daniel Way (Deadpool, Daken) to create their own very graphic novel entitled Kill-Crazy Nymphos Attack! with artist Rob Dumo & cover artist Dave Johnson which is a pitch black satire on patriarchal society and women's roles within it. The very graphic novel is set with a 2017 release date.September 16th, 2015, also marks the release of Jen & Sylvia Soska's first collaboration with Marvel comics with their Night Nurse story line 'The Risk of Infection' featured in Secret Wars Journal #5. The Soska twins have been long time fans of Marvel Comics and been quite vocal in their interests to tackle the adaptation of one of their stories for the big screen with them at the helm as directors. In April it was announced that the twins would be teaming with Marvel again, this time writing 'The Ripley' as a Guardians of the Galaxy story featured in Guardians of Infinity #8.The media that the twins take on ever expanding, the Soska Sisters are the hosts of the survival horror game-show called Hellevator that premiered October 21 2015 on GSN. The show is a creation from Blumhouse, GSN, Matador, and Lionsgate. The show just enjoyed its second season and received even more attention when it was made available on VOD through Netflix and Hulu proving that evil twins continue to have a rich history with elevators and scaring people.In February 2016, the directing duo of Jen and Sylvia Soska came on board to direct a remake of David Cronenberg's 1977 zombie thriller Rabid. John Vidette's Somerville House Releasing entered into a joint venture with Paul Lalonde and Michael Walker to produce a feature film and original TV series based on the 1977 Canadian horror film.December 11, 2016 will mark the twins' company, Twisted Twins Productions' 8 year anniversary which will have them with 4 feature films, 2 graphic novels, a series of blood donation PSAs, and a television show. Not too shabby for a pair of twins from Canada who set their sites on shaking up the entertainment industry playing by their own rules and leaving a hefty cinematic body count in their wake.","April 29, 1983 in North Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada",1983-04-29,"North Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada",,,,,,0,0,0,0

The completed film - embraced by horror fans, film festivals, and critics - became an underground sensation, called ""a hidden gem in indie film-making"" and ""a cult classic in the waiting"", and won multiple awards: Pollygrind's Favorite Feature, Best Screenplay, City of Death's Best Director Award, and Cinefantasy's Audience Favorite Prize.In 2008 the twins incorporated, Twisted Twins Productions -- to create their own label for many future projects to come, including their highly anticipated second feature, American Mary, an analogy of their own struggles in the film industry. American Mary has gone on to win numerous praise and awards. The film has gone on to become a cult classic and the various costumes of the lead character Mary Mason a Halloween and horror convention favorite for cos-players.The Soska Sisters have gone on to be very outspoken about equal rights across the board including but not limited to gender equality and equal rights for the LGBT community. They're actively involved in promoting blood donation and create a new PSA for it every February. And they are only just getting started.2014 was a big year with the Soska Sisters bringing a new life to See No Evil 2 where they resurrect the WWE Studios franchise with WWE Superstar Glenn ""Kane"" Jacobs reprising his role as Jacob Goodnight and scream queens Danielle Harris and Katharine Isabelle appear together for the first time. As well, the Twins will be one of the all star director line up for ABCs of Death 2 in a segment that will shock and be destined for cult status. Their segment, T is for Torture Porn, has since been banned in Germany.In 2015, the twins did a genre jump, teaming again with Lionsgate and WWE Studios, with a action revenge thriller called Vendetta to star, Dean Cain, Paul 'Big Show' Wight, and Michael Eklund. The high action, ultra gory nature of the film proved that the sisters are not one trick ponies as they expand their sensibilities to this Justin Shady written, men's prison revenge flick.Avid comic book fans, the Soska Sisters have teamed up with Daniel Way (Deadpool, Daken) to create their own very graphic novel entitled Kill-Crazy Nymphos Attack! with artist Rob Dumo & cover artist Dave Johnson which is a pitch black satire on patriarchal society and women's roles within it. The very graphic novel is set with a 2017 release date.September 16th, 2015, also marks the release of Jen & Sylvia Soska's first collaboration with Marvel comics with their Night Nurse story line 'The Risk of Infection' featured in Secret Wars Journal #5. The Soska twins have been long time fans of Marvel Comics and been quite vocal in their interests to tackle the adaptation of one of their stories for the big screen with them at the helm as directors. In April it was announced that the twins would be teaming with Marvel again, this time writing 'The Ripley' as a Guardians of the Galaxy story featured in Guardians of Infinity #8.The mediums that the twins take on ever expanding, the Soska Sisters are the hosts of the survival horror game-show called Hellevator that premiered October 21 2015 on GSN. The show is a creation from Blumhouse, GSN, Matador, and Lionsgate. The show just enjoyed it's second season and received even more attention when it was made available on VOD through Netflix and Hulu proving that evil twins continue to have a rich history with elevators and scaring people.In February 2016, the directing duo of Jen and Sylvia Soska came on board to direct a remake of David Cronenberg's 1977 zombie thriller Rabid. John Vidette's Somerville House Releasing entered into a joint venture with Paul Lalonde and Michael Walker to produce a feature film and original TV series based on the 1977 Canadian horror film.December 11, 2016 will mark the twins' company, Twisted Twins Productions' 8 year anniversary which will have them with 4 feature films, 2 graphic novels, a series of blood donation PSAs, and a television show. Not too shabby for a pair of twins from Canada who set their sites on shaking up the entertainment industry playing by their own rules and leaving a hefty cinematic body count in their wake.","April 29, 1983 in North Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada",1983-04-29,"North Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada",,,,,,0,0,0,0

nm3638923,Isaac Halasima,Isaac Halasima,,"Born in Provo, Utah. Isaac Halasima's father (Timote Halasima) immigrated from the country of Tonga in the 70's to Hawaii, where he met and married his mother (Kaye Fisher), a University art student from Idaho. Her brother, Jan Fisher, was a celebrated sculpture and professor of art at the school his mother attended. After the marriage, she relocated to Pleasant Grove, Utah, to raise her son close to family.Halasima began dancing competitively at age five, and won a national dance title by age 14. And as a mixed race child in the not-so-diverse state of Utah, acting jobs began to open up consistently for the performer. By the time Isaac had graduated from High School he had starred in multiple movies and TV Series, while racking up loads of broadcasting awards including a couple Emmy Awards with the kids TV series he hosted called Zinj TV.After high school he walk away from acting, to focus on working behind the camera. He received a scholarship to attend Utah Valley University in broadcasting, where he would win more honors including the University's ""Talent of the Year"" award. It was in recognition of his work in creating, producing, and directing three tv series that ran on the university's cable channel all four years he was in school.During his internship with the NBC affiliate in Salt Lake City, KSL-TV, he was offered a full time position work as a producer and editor. So he dropped out of school and, with KSL Sports, he continued his run of awards. This time winning multiple broadcasting and Journalism awards. But the goal was always to be a film director; so after five years he went free-lance with a focus to direct film and improve as a storyteller.Isaac made his first big national move as a director with his music videos ""Demons"" and ""Gold"" for the band Imagine Dragons (Demons was nominated for an MTV/VMA as the ""Rock Video of the Year""). His documentary ""The Making of Night Visions"", which chronicled the making of Imagine Dragons first studio album, played in select theaters nationally; before being picked up by VH1/Palladio for broadcast on their channels. He also helped in the creation and directing of the TV Documentary series, 'Audio-Files'. The Doc-Series, which takes an artistic look at bands and their performances was created by Matt Eastin; a fellow director and friend from High School and college who Isaac still collaborates with on different projects. With 'Audio-Files' he worked and continued to direct artists and musicians like the ban LOW, Neon Trees, Mason Jennings, Trampled by Turtles, Paper Route, and his friends Imagine Dragons.Commercially, Isaac has worked all over the world while directing actors and personalities like Alec Baldwin, Devon Bostick, Mike Ditka, and Marshawn Lynch to name a few. Working with brands, networks, and companies like the NBA, MLS, NBC, CBS, ESPN, along with national tech companies such as Domo.In 2016 Halasima wrote, directed, and produced his first feature film 'The Last Descent' that played in theaters all over the western United States. It's a true story based on a tragic event in his home state of Utah. The film was well received by critics and audiences alike, eventually winning Utah Film Awards and Nominations for nearly every category available. Isaac won an award for Cinematography, but was also nominated for his work in directing, editing, visual FX, and some of the scoring on the movie.Recently, Isaac partnered with Vid-Angel Studios to create and direct the break-out standup comedy series 'Dry Bar Comedy' that has exploded in popularity across the country. The on-line series is averaging 20 Million views a week as of 2019. It plays across multiple platforms like Youtube, Amazon Video, Sirius/XM, and it's own Dry Bar Comedy application for most devices. Halasima has directed most of the specials that, as of now, has turned into four seasons and nearly 100 comedians performances in their own unique Comedy Specials.He is also currently directing and producing a documentary on Duke Kahanamoku with Sidewinder Films, who is a producing group with multiple Academy Award Nominations; it's most recent in 2019. The documentary is a very personal project for Halasima, with Duke Kahanamoku being one of the most revered and celebrated figures of his Polynesians heritage. He is also connected to the image of Duke through his uncle, Jan Fisher, who made the world famous statue of Duke on the beach of Waikiki in Hawaii. Uncle Jan, is the inspiration for chasing the story celebrate Halasima's Polynesian roots.Extras:In 2012, Isaac collaborated with his friend Branden Steineckert (drummer for the famous band Rancid) to make a fan video for Real Salt Lake (Major League Soccer). Branden wrote and recorded the song in his Orem home, and then they shot the video with a little over 20 fans in about 2 hours. The video ""Believe RSL"" has since been played before every home game at the stadium, and has gained recognition and praise from soccer teams in every large league around the world. Since the videos release in 2012, the song is sung by the home fans in the stadium before and after every game, and again after every goal. Also, the lyrics of the song are now stitched into the collars of the jerseys of every player on the team.He's an active participant, supporter, and speaker for the PolyStrong organization. Which focuses on helping Polynesian kids prepare for future careers and a better life.Isaac's step-father, Larry Fugal, came out as gay when Isaac was 13 years old. Yet remained close and a father figure long after the marriage to his mother had ended. To this day Isaac still calls him ""Dad.""He has only been known as Isaac Halasima since he was 19 years old. Before then he was known by his step-fathers surname, ""Fugal.""Isaac was a medal bearer at the 2002 Olympics in Salt Lake City. Charged with bringing the medals to out the champions during the medals ceremony, in front of a nightly crowd of 20k fans, so officials could place them on the necks of the winners. He was also a dancer performing on the main stages and different venues during the two week Olympic Event.During the 2002 Olympics, he also picked up one of his favorite ""random things in life"" stories to tell. Where during one of his weirdest days, he found himself watching N'Sync perform on stage while sharing a booth with Mitt Romney.Isaac is also an award winning editor in documentaries and film, and gives credit to his 20+ years of dance, both competitively and professionally, for his unique style and pacing in his editing and directing. He still teaches dance classes in Orem UT when he gets free time.A die-hard New York Mets fan, he hides a ""shout out"" to the Mets in all his work.Halasima has been releasing and selling different orchestral compositions and recordings under a pseudonym since 2006.Isaac was voted ""Most Likely to Succeed"" by his High School Radio Station, where he was the youngest to ever run his own broadcast show at 16, and also worked as a station manager. He also, thanks to his little sister rallying the fellow Tongans in Utah County, led all DJ's in listenership and requests.As a 5th grader, Isaac accomplished his goal of winning top honors in three categories of the Reflections competition at his school. Winning in painting, song writing, and photography. His painting would go on display in Washington D.C. for the national competition where he won national honors.He briefly followed in his fathers footsteps as High School athlete lettering in track, and then as a collegiate athlete, playing Rugby for Utah Valley University.At 14, Brenda Beinberg, a second mother figure and one of a two producer-duo for a Television show that he had hosted for two seasons; was shot and killed by her husband in an argument while the third season was in production.

He lives with his beautiful Animal-Whisperer wife Karen and has two awesome and successful sons Fraser and Graham.Drummond's low-key humour and reliable, hardworking nature have helped him emerge as a solid, talented and professional actor who adds value to every production. Having recently finished his 38th film and television production and 31st Commercial project, Drummond has built a broad base of acting experience, as well as many dramatic and musical stage roles.Drummond's tremendous ""been there- done that"" depth of experience allows him to play the ""suffer no fools"" loving dad you just don't want to screw with when he's protecting his family (Chris Cooper in American Beauty), or the burnt out but relentless lawyer who's still quick with the joke. He is the military General, the senior FBI operative, Head Detective or Coroner, and is great as the tough but loving Coach (Million Dollar Baby)As a former high-level investment banker, put Drummond in a suit and he's the ruthless business tycoon ... dressed down, he commands that Sam Shepard/Nicholas Campbell rugged cowboy/blue-collar charm.

Drummond's smart, strong and sensitive character will surprise you as he reveals both the light and dark side of the human condition.Drummond has enjoyable portraying a wide range of characters, from a psychopath, serial killer-Photographer in The Poacher (2011), to a dedicated and intense U.S. Lieut.

She would sing in both English and Spanish and knew at a young age, that she had a passion for being on camera. This blossomed into a modeling career as a teenager, which led to a contract in Japan at the age of 17. By the age of 18, Marcella was given opportunities to work in film and TV and booked several national commercials.After having her daughter Sophia in 2003, Marcella took a break to spend time with her daughter. Then, after being discovered on Facebook by a producer, when Sophia was older, Marcella was encouraged to continue pursuing her dreams in entertainment. After studying Meisner at the Joanne Baron Studio in Santa Monica, and meeting her wonderful agent and manager, Marcella found herself, once again, in front of the camera doing what she loved. She worked as the supporting actress on several features and shorts, The Violent World of Parker (2013), Time in Between (2016), Second Coming of Christ (2016). In 2015, Marcella landed the lead role opposite the love of her life, Vincent Rivera in the film, Insane. Her commercial with Today in LA, which aired during Super Bowl XLIX did so well, that the network picked it up for another year and it aired this past Superbowl (2016).Marcella's relationship with actor and producer, Vincent Rivera, has been an inspirational journey on Marcella's path. While pursuing their own careers in the industry, and developing their own experiences, Marcella and Vincent started an acting school together in 2014. They wanted to create a safe place for other actors/artists to develop their craft on a personal and spiritual level.

nm3652766,Carlotta Montanari,Carlotta Montanari,164,"Carlotta Sofia Montanari is an Italian-American actress born in Rimini, Italy. Raised in Riccione, a seaside city of northern Italy, she made her professional artistic debut at an early age acting and hosting for major national networks and appearing in commercials and films. As a child, she originally wanted to work with animals, possibly a veterinarian or professional horseback rider and trainer. She has carried her passion for animals and horses into her adulthood and it remains one of the biggest pleasures of her life.Due to the separation of her parents Carlotta, along with her brother, spent much of her childhood at her family's countryside home with her grandparents, where she was surrounded by animals and developed a deep connection and respect for animals and nature.Growing up she considered becoming a filmmaker, given her passion for the big screen, old movies and filming, but later she studied and graduated with a Master of Visual Arts at The Federico Fellini Institute. Thereafter, she studied journalism and communication sciences to broaden her skill base, but Carlotta was still searching for her calling until she was invited to join an intensive acting seminar based on the methods of Konstantin Stanislavski and Lee Strasberg. This form of creative expression was an immediate connection, and she felt that acting would be her lifetime companion and a healing playground. The desire to work professionally and measure herself further as an actor inspired her to move to Rome to train in theatre full time. In Rome, Carlotta worked also as a television host and writer.Driven by her aspiration to work with the masters of the acting craft, Carlotta left Rome for Los Angeles to further her career. Shortly after earning her first acting role, she was invited to the prestigious The Actors Studio moderated by Hollywood legends and mentors Martin Landau, Salome Jens, Mark Rydell and Lou Antonio. She also worked with teachers such as Penny Allen and Allan Miller.As a versatile actress, Carlotta has acted in several Hollywood feature films and TV shows. She also has appeared in television and print commercials, and her artistic work includes voice over and dubbing.Carlotta is a compassionate animal rights advocate and philanthropist, including helping the less fortunate in her community, WWF, leukemia and MS research, and associations against domestic abuse. She is an active volunteer and supporter of several dog and horse rescue organizations in Southern California.","February 17, 1981 in Rimini, Emilia-Romagna, Italy",1981-02-17,"Rimini, Emilia-Romagna, Italy",,,,,,0,0,0,0

What followed were five wayward years earning minimal pay working crummy jobs, several of which he was fired from. He started writing when he was 24 and, at age 27, left capitalism behind and moved to New York City to attend Columbia University's School of the Arts. He graduated in May 2009 with a Master of Fine Arts in Creative Writing (fiction). His first novel sold one month later.Hughes is the pseudonymous coauthor of the novels ""I am Number Four"" and ""The Power of Six"", both of which were published by HarperCollins. Together they have collectively spent ten weeks at #1 on the New York Times Best Sellers List and have sold well over a million copies worldwide. Sono il numero quattro (2011) was made into a feature film by DreamWorks Studios. Released on February 18, 2011, it was directed by D.J. Caruso, produced by Michael Bay, and starred Alex Pettyfer in the titular role. With an estimated budget of $50 million, the film earned $146 million at the worldwide box office.Hughes lives in Michigan.

After a year in the Windy City, the allure of sunnier days, beaches, and film and television parts had him moving west to Hollywood.In a story right out of a Hollywood script, he sold his nice car for an older cheaper one.

His whole time growing up he was the guy who wanted to make everyone laugh, thinking up silly skits and acting them out. Thomas moved to California when he turned 19 and became a father at the age of 20. However, fatherhood would not slow down his creativeness; actually, it gave him a new audience, 3 beautiful children: Erika, William and Brooklyn. But with fatherhood came responsibility. In other words, a full-time salary. Thomas went into the environmental industry where his new audience awaited in the form of his clients. As a salesmen he had many opportunities to share stories and entertain. In 2007, there was an offer by the television network TLC to have Thomas' environmental company test as part of a reality show, Revolutionaries (on-camera, Thomas was the Environmental Inspector). This was a learning experience that lead to Thomas enrolling in several acting classes and intensive seminars - he was in love. In class he would learn only some aspects of the acting business and consequently set out to gain real-world experience through theater, short films, commercials and even small parts in feature films.In 2010, Thomas started H2 Crew productions, allowing him to produce his own films while continuing to learn and grow in the entertainment industry. With H2 Crew's first film, Horsepower, it was clear Thomas was hooked. To this day Thomas is always there to help out on a film. Whether it be acting, writing, producing or directing, Thomas enjoys it all.In 2012, Thomas set out to write a short film and produce it to H2 Crew's highest standards yet - ""a feature-worthy short film."" Thomas teamed up with Dan Jagels, an experienced and battle-proven director. The film was Thirteen and the goal was ScreamFEST. The film was shot on a RED camera, in 4K with Cinema Lenses. The production lasted 8 days with locations spanning from East Los Angeles County to Las Vegas, Nevada. In 2013, H2 Crew's goal was realized: Thirteen became an official selection of ScreamFEST, as well as 7 other film festivals.In 2014, Thomas wanted to try his hand in Directing and wrote Officer Down, a 5-minute, on the edge of your seat short film, in the hopes of having it become an official selection of several 2014 film festivals.","October 16, 1968 in Phoenix, Arizona, USA",1968-10-16,"Phoenix, Arizona, USA",,,,,Amy Haley  (14 May 1994 - present) (divorced) (3 children),1,1,1,3

She proudly took 3rd Place in the Adult Female Improv Competition. It was an amazing experience for her to compete against other actors from around the U.S. and beyond. Trena's previous roles range from a mother/housewife being hunted by a mysterious Bigfoot-like creature, to a secretary, nurse, escaped captive, a ruthless Russian drug-lord, and even a kooky witch in a comedy web-series about a bunch of medieval role-playing misfits, just to name a few. Her love of horror films has always intrigued her from a very young age. At 8 years old, she asked her Father to take her to see The Exorcist and it forever changed her, which is why her dream role is to break the stereotypical female roles by portraying a deranged killer.

Govinda was his favorite actor. Often teased by his cousins by the name filmy encyclopedia, he ended up directing lots of skits/plays in his school and college days.Post engineering he continued his stint with theatre. In 2007, Naveen along with his college friends started a theatre company called Right Click Entertainment under which he wrote and directed his first ticketed play called ""Khel Khel Mein"" which ran houseful and then there was no turning back.His first job in films was of an assistant director on a film called Jashnn. The film was produced by Vishesh films and directed by director duo Hasnain Hyderabadwala and Raksha Mistry.When he was in college, Khosla ka Ghosla had made Dibakar Banerjee his favorite director and he was desperate to assist him. When he went to meet him to ask for an AD job, Dibakar instead asked him to act in one of his coke commercials. That's how he made his acting debut in television commercials. Today Naveen Kasturia is a very popular ad face with more than 50 ads under his belt, Vodafone and Mahindra's being the most popular ones.He went on to assist Dibakar Banerjee on two films, LSD and Shanghai.

Since Naveen was also trying to pitch his film script to productions and doing some trivial TV writing jobs, Amit felt he would be perfect to play the part. The film was a turning point in his career, it made him an actor.During his ad days, he had also met an IITian Arunabh Kumar in order to assist him on a film Arunabh was about to direct. The film never happened but two became friends and stayed in touch. Later they collaborated on a sketch called Rowdies, which became a rage and also led to the emergence of Arunabh's YouTube channel TVF.

Dub C quoted ""Flip brought out the best in me on this album"", impressive considering he is from Boston. On ""I Wanna Ride"" Flip collaborates with legendary ""NWA"" members ""Ice Cube"" and ""MC Ren"". This west coast anthem is reminiscent of an era when the west coast dominated the hip hop scene. On ""Bang Loose"" he teams up with west coast soldiers, ""Dr. Stank, Daville and Lady T"" putting on a production clinic. On ""Tha Get tagetha"" featuring ""Butch Cassidy"" he displays diversity being from the east coast with the creativity to produce a vintage west coast track.

Acting and presenting for the screen makes up a large part of his work, whether it is film, TV, commercial or corporate.

He'd also worked behind the camera as director, producer, editor, and in casting - winning seven awards for films directed, and receiving the 2014 Emerging Filmmaker Award from the Kansas City Film Fest.This culminated in more career moves, & the goal of joining the episodic storytelling movement. The following years saw him quickly turn SAG-AFTRA and add seven episodic roles to his resume, before expanding his big-budget feature horizons with D'Onofrio's directorial debut THE KID, & joining the Breaking Bad universe in EL CAMINO, as SEAN LIEBOLD.His passion for bringing roles to life with authenticity and empathy is only rivaled by his extreme work ethic, as he continues to refine his art and craft intriguing characters from his home base in LA.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0

nm3857479,Kelsey Zukowski,Kelsey Alyse Zukowski,165,"Kelsey Zukowski is an experienced and passionate screenwriter, actress, and model, specializing in the horror genre through dark examination. Based in Los Angeles, she has worked on productions across the country, working heavily in the indie horror scene in Chicago as well as LA. Zukowski is most well-known for penning and co-starring in the surreal dark drama, ""What They Say"", winning awards at film festivals across the country. More recently her tale of real life horrors of bullying and abuse in the psychological slasher, ""Words Like Knives"", premiered at Blood at the Beach festival in Virginia Beach. Zukowski is working on the feature haunted house film, ""Within These Walls"", a gritty collaboration with filmmaker James Tucker, centering on a disturbing ghost story that brings out complete entrapment and relentless torment of one girl as she struggles to find her inner-strength (played by Zukowski).Zukowski is a huge believer in all that the horror genre is capable of. She strives to dive in to the good and the bad, the light and darkness, that surrounds us, in a creative, justifying sense through the genre. She eagerly ventures in to other genres, but her home is in horror. Zukowski was heavily inspired at an early age by the Halloween franchise, A Nightmare on Elm Street, and fellow Cleveland-native, Wes Craven's surreal and 'fighting through the mind' brand of horror in particular.Zukowski has a background in theater, having fallen in love with acting during a school production when she was 10. This love of acting proved to be a love of storytelling and the cinema in particular. When Zukowski was 14 she began writing film reviews, greatly inspired by the late Roger Ebert's writing style and ability to relay the entire movie going experience in his reviews. While still in high school in Ohio, Zukowski's film reviews were being published in the California-based newspaper, The Valley Voice. She has been a published film critic for the past 7 years writing for a variety of websites including Criticsword.com, HorrorYearbook.com, FilmArcade.net, DirectorsLive.com, TheCelebrityCafe.com, and 8th-circuit.com. She's written TV recaps, music and movie reviews, news stories, and has conducted interviews with independent film makers around the world. She has covered and shown appreciation for all types of films from low budget independent to Hollywood mainstream and always eager to highlight foreign films or unknown gems.Zukowski has a Bachelors of Arts in Digital Cinema with a concentration in Screenwriting from DePaul University. Shortly after graduating, Zukowski became involved with the independent film scene. Some of her earliest roles were in various productions of crime writer, Kevin Jamison's intense serial killer depictions, the throwback horror anthology ""Psycho Street"", and the Autumn Offering ""Born Dead"" music video, which aired on MTV2's Head Banger's Ball. From acting she bridged in to modeling, working heavily with alternative, pin-up, and glamor modeling. As in her writing, Zukowski is most drawn to thematic, stylistic modeling that has an artistic expression, human emotion, and creates a singular world within an image.","November 13, 1988",1988-11-13,,,,,,,0,0,0,0

Moussi began his martial arts training in the art of jujutsu under Canadian martial arts legend John Therien and also trained in kickboxing under legendary kickboxing champion Jean-Yves Theriault. He had trained in Brazilian jiu-jitsu under Carlos Machado, eventually earning his black belt in the art. Moussi got his start as a stuntman and credits Jean Frenette, a former world martial arts champion turned stunt coordinator for films, with giving him his start. His first job was doubling Henry Cavill in the film Immortals. He has doubled for Travis Fimmel in Warcraft, Hugh Jackman in X-Men: Apocalypse, and Jai Courtney in Suicide Squad.At the Cannes Film Festival in 2014, it was announced he would get his first lead role in a reboot of the 1989 film Kickboxer, which starred Jean-Claude Van Damme. In Kickboxer: Vengeance, Moussi played Kurt Sloane, a young martial artist who must refine his skills to avenge his brother's death. Van Damme himself replaced the departing Tony Jaa as Kurt's teacher, now named Master Durand. The film received mixed reviews but the confidence of the film resulted in two sequels, Kickboxer: Retaliation, released in 2017, and Kickboxer: Syndicate, which began production in February 2017. The sequels bring Moussi back as Kurt Sloane and in addition, Moussi and longtime friend Jean-Francois LaChappelle served as fight choreographers of Retaliation.Moussi also played the role of Charlie Nash in the web series sequel Street Fighter: Resurrection.","March 29, 1981 in Libreville, Gabon",1981-03-29,"Libreville, Gabon",,,,,Janie Des Rosiers  (4 April 2012 - present),1,0,0,0

He left his Shakespearean tights at the door, and spilled big screen blood all the way through Five Towns College.Balsamo appears on both sides of the camera in many of his works, including his most recent project, Hack Job.

The director was looking for a seven-year old and was reluctant to audition a five-year old, but things changed when they met and the director adjusted the script to suit the younger girl. She appeared in a historical drama in 2011. She was given the lead role in the serial Sayonara Bokutachi No Youchien ('Good-bye Our Kindergarten') in 2011, which made her at age six the youngest lead actress in Japanese TV history. She appeared in Marumo No Okite ('Marumo's Rule') and also sang the serial's theme song, Maru Maru Mori Mori. It sold enough to be a Top 10 hit. She next became one of the winners of the Rookie Of The Year Award at the 34th Japan Academy Awards for her work in the movie Ghost. She also branched out into voice-over for foreign films' dub into Japanese. She furthermore became the youngest person to win Japan's Blue Ribbon Award. She was the host for the talk-show Meringue No Kimochi in 2011 thus becoming the youngest talk or variety show hostess ever in Japan. She signed with Universal Music and debuted a single and an album and was in the Hollywood movie Pacific Rim by 2013. However, before that she supported her music career by giving concerts in 2012. She had earlier become the winner of Celebrity Kids Edition of the Japanese version of the contest Who Wants To Be A Millionaire. She is an avid reader and rides a unicycle. It is said that she could read by age four and would read sixty books a month beginning from kindergarten. Her fans call her Manachan.

nm3874849,Petar Strugar,Petar Strugar,187,"Petar was born in Cetinje in Montenegro, because Budva doesn't have maternity hospital of its own. His father, Vladimir, is a former volleyball coach and his mother, Dragana, was an accountant. Petar grew up on Adriatic coast, in Budva, where he went to elementary school ""Stefan Mitrov Ljubisa"". Later he enrolled into high school ""JUSMS Danilo Kis"", wanting to become a seaman or professional volleyball player when he grows up. While attending high school he got a job as a drummer in a local marching band and as an actor and skit writer in a local TV teenage series named ""Cool"". Thanks to this Petar enrolled into his high-school drama section. All the while he trained for a professional volleyball player.After he graduated high school, his drama teacher begged him to try to enroll into Faculty of Dramatic Arts in Cetinje. But the time was short, only five days till entrance exam, so Peter decided to go for Maritime Faculty in Kotor, department of Nautics. But thespian demons didn't leave Petar alone, so the next day he went to Faculty of Dramatic Arts in Cetinje, and though he didn't learn his lines nor what he was supposed to do the professors panel recognized his talent and accepted him.He began his studies in drama, but while attending his third year he was offered a role in a motion picture that would be shot in Belgrade. Peter went on a casting that turned into a month of traveling back and forth from Cetinje to Belgrade, while simultaneously preparing a stage play in Cetinje. So he would travel to Belgrade by night, on a train, do casting, and then return to Cetinje during the day and went on rehearsals.One of the requirements for him to get the motion picture role was that he would have to learn how to play football and master the Serbian accent. So he froze his studies in Montenegro and moved to Belgrade full time.After perfecting the two Petar got the role of Blagoje ""Mosa"" Marjanovic in Dragan Bjelogrlic's ""Montevideo: Taste of a Dream"" (2010), for which he got an award. He played the same role in sequel ""See You in Montevideo"" (2014). The part of Mosa launched young Petar to stardom. After finishing the two ""Montevideo"" movies and eponymous TV series, Strugar guest starred in local TV series. But cinema audiences wanted more of the young actor. He got the lead role in hit comedy ""Little Buddho"" (2014) for which he mastered a rhoticism and got an extra weight of 20 kg (about 40 pounds).Next year he got the role of underground fighter Vladica, in action-comedy ""The Samurai in Autumn"" (2016) for which he turned the extra weight into muscles. The movie was not as well received as Strugar's previous feature, but everyone praised his transformation and talent. Sometime later Petar got a recurring role on Croatian soap ""Prava zena"" and a cameo in Nikola Kojo's ""Stado"" (2016).Now he resides in Belgrade, where he's preparing to become a member of an international stunt team as an actor-stuntman.","May 23, 1988 in Cetinje, Montenegro, Yugoslavia",1988-05-23,"Cetinje, Montenegro, Yugoslavia",,,,,Ivana Nikolic  (November 2013 - 2015) (divorced) (1 child),1,1,1,1

When he was less than a year old his family moved to Stroudsburg, PA where he was raised with his two sisters Olivia and Leslie. From a young age, Jared would write plays that he and his cousins would perform during family functions on sets he and his grandfather George Vega (who also built the collapsible furniture for Saturday Night Live's Samurai skits in the 1970s) had built. At 12 years old he spent a short time as a runway model before entering his awkward teen years. Just before his 18th birthday he and two friends opened a head shop called ""The Odyssey,"" but numerous break-ins caused the store to close six months later. Shortly after that Jared joined the US Army Reserves where he was eventually discharged due to a severe injury to his right hand. Upon returning to civilian life he began selling cars while attending East Stroudsburg University. He was certain by this point he wanted to get into entertainment but was unsure just how to do it. He and another friend began planning a concert, but unable to obtain outside financing, were forced to think outside the box. They formed a small technology firm Down Under Consulting to raise to the money, despite their best effort, internal squabble forced the company's dissolve a short time later. It wasn't until 2006 that alongside music producer Michael Calderone, Jared organized and produced his first full scale concert. The following year the pair had thrown numerous music festivals until Michael had received a recording contract with Armada Music. Although offered a management position with his partner, Jared knew there was little room for advancement and held out for another opportunity. In 2009, Director Nick Stagliano offered Jared a chance to help produce his feature film ""Good Day For It."" Since then he has helped produce several films including Jay Alaimo's ""Chlorine"" and has appeared in such shows as NBC's ""30 Rock"" and Fox's ""Running Wilde,"" where he is featured as Steve Wilde's personal gardener.","August 20, 1979 in New York, New York, USA",1979-08-20,"New York, New York, USA",,,,,,0,0,0,0

Novels like ""Of mice and men"" and movies like ""Apollo 13, Forrest Gump, Edward Scissorhands, Contact and Ghostbusters"" inspired him to start writing and directing films at a very young age.James got a hold of his father's VHS camera and shot his first movie at the age of ten, it was then however that tragedy struck his family. During that time James sought the comfort of the familiar worlds that novels and films created; it was here that James made the final decision. Using the pain from his Mother's illness, he set forth and starting moving forward with his dream of writing and directing film.Throughout school James continued his pursuit of his dreams, choosing to write for many of the early years.

Quickly he rose through the ranks, and eventually he landed on the morning show as the director of the morning newscast.James continued to direct for several years, before eventually leaving to work towards writing and directing film professionally. Using a unique style of dramatic themes with escapism visuals, and molding real life occurrences from his life into his films has allowed him to create several award winning films.After the untimely death of his mother in 2009, James began to aggressively push into filmmaking.The first being an award winning post-apocalyptic film titled ""26 Years"" that was based on the experience of watching his mother struggle to find herself again after she was in a coma.The second being an award winning drama titled ""Into That Good Night"" that again was based on an actual conversation he had with his mother two days before her untimely death. This film went on to be used by several hospice care centers in California to help grieving families learn to cope with loss.The third film, The Astronaut, is the story of a father and son centered around his relationship with his own father has been receiving strong praise after it's theatrical release and just recently in the film was in the 2015 Festival de Cannes in France.James has also expanded into graphic novels, with his breakout horror novel ""Inheritance"", which is a story about two generations of a family that struggles to piece their world back together.

Having shared a stage with Buddy Guy, played to thousands at the V&A in London, composed for ballet at the Bloomsbury Theatre, Nokia and Lego commercials as well as several award winning feature films, it is safe to say that Luke's commercial knowledge and musical experience is far from average. At an early age, Luke studied music composition & jazz in Madrid, under Berklee College of Music professor Pedro Iturralde whilst studying world cinema with a focus on Mizoguchi, Antonioni, F.W. Murnau and Billy Wilder. In early 2000 he was spotted by famed talent scout Rob Deacon and signed to Deviant Records to later appear on some of the best selling releases of the decade including Now 2004 alongside Kylie Minogue and Justin Timberlake. In those early days he also recorded with #1 artist Robert Owens (Fingers Inc) picking up praise along the way from Boy George and Jon Marsh. As the first decade of the millennium progressed, Luke solidified his work in advertising, especially in collaboration with award-winning agency Salt TV while composing for ABC News' documentary Trivial Royale - covering the Royal Wedding - and writing songs for BBC series E20. In 2011 Luke scores the music for British thriller 'The Smoke' (Matt Di Angelo, Alan Ford) and multi-award winning air disaster film 'Last Flight to Abuja'. He received an African Movie Academy Award, known as the African 'Oscar' for his African folklore-infused music score in the film Onye Ozi. Several independent film commissions followed, such as 'Hard Time Bus' (Best Film - Hollywood Black Film Festival), additional music to Vanessa Parise' 'Status:Unknown' and British thriller 'Welcome To Curiosity' (featuring Richard Blackwood). Then later in 2016, Luke wrote the music for Tomasz Szafranski's 'No Panic With a Hint of Hysteria' (Stephen Baldwin, Zbigniew Zamachowski), a fast paced hilarious black comedy described by some critics as Baldwin's best performance in decades. Recently, and between film breaks, Luke has composed the music for the opening of YiHaus in Shanghai - world's largest commercial shopping village. Since 2018 Luke co-manages Fizz-e-Motion, an international film distribution company comprising a music scoring and publishing department. with a catalogue of over 15 films and another five in production or development.",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0

Following his success in athletics, T.C.'s desires shifted to a career in film and television. In 2004, T.C. landed a spot on Animal Planet's King of the Jungle, a hit network reality television show in which he emerged as the season 2 champion.

In 2008-after a successful Skype audition from the living room of his Louisville, KY home- TC made his feature film debut in the 2011 hit movie, ""Courageous"" portraying the memorable character, ""TJ"". Following this feat, TC gave up a successful personal training business in Louisville and headed for Hollywood. After a few months of auditioning, TC would land two commercials, followed by three more film roles. But TC's career reached new heights with his break-out performance as ""Tony Jordan"" in the 2015 hit film, ""War Room"", which soared to #1 at the box office. He would later land a nomination for Best Actor at the ICFF for his lead role in ""God's Compass"", followed by a Best Actor win at the CFF for his supporting role in ""Unbridled"". TC also found continual success in booking TV commercials, with two of them being featured during the 2016 Rio Olympics and the 2016 Superbowl. In 2019, his company (Team TC Productions) reached a milestone when TC wrote, directed and self-produced a documentary called ""24 Counter: The Story Behind the Run"", which was nominated for ""Most Inspirational Documentary"" by the ICFF.

She has a younger sister, Madison Marie Steinacker - both girls were adopted at birth.Ever since the young age of four, Alyssa has been inspired by the performing arts, begging her parents to put her in multiple dance and vocal classes throughout her childhood. Her love for acting wasn't discovered until she was nearly 9-years old when she was put into a musical theater class, where she learned basic theater terminology, how to deliver a monologue, and how to sing and dance at the same time. Rooted in the musical theater class, Alyssa Steinacker's love for acting developed into a curiosity about TV and film acting. With support from both her parents, Alyssa began studying at John Robert Powers, Tampa, FL, where she then signed up for a widely-known talent showcase called IPOP! This showcase is where she landed her first manager, who strongly encouraged Alyssa and her family to move across the country to pursue an acting career in California.Shortly thereafter, Alyssa began booking commercials and supporting roles in films. Finally, she landed her first leading role as Lisa Marie Dawson in Broken Angels. In this indie drama, her single Step Away is featured, and she began developing a music career from there, working with Aaron Anderson, Sam Saltzer, and Andrew Lane. Her music got her an award for Pop Artist of the Year by The LA Music Awards 25th Anniversary, hosted by Al Bowman. Alyssa Steinacker's most recent films include Those Left Behind (2016), where she plays opposite of Nickelodeon's Jack Griffo and alongside Daphne Zuniga and Michael Hogan, and Don't Come Back from the Moon (2017) with James Franco, Rashida Jones, Jeff Wahlberg.Alyssa Elle Steinacker can also be seen in No Tomorrow (2012), The Zeroes (2014), and Crazy Bitches (2014).",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0

Creatively inspired by the German Expressionistic mind of Tim Burton, Mitchel began spinning short stories of his own and developing stop motion animation films on an old VHS camcorder, and with that his love for the process of film was discovered. Amidst perfecting his wicked skateboarding skills, incredible talents for guitar and music creation, his teen years focused his writing efforts into horror screenplays. After high school Mitchel attempted to major in film at the University of Toledo only to discover the curriculum a joke and his skills far beyond the general techniques of the hobbyist students around him. Bored with this, he branched out on his own choosing to spend his tuition money on film equipment... This allowed him to work on several short film projects before setting out on his own to shoot his first short film project with another student entitled ""The Pilfer"". The short was well received and unique for it's time.Having spent a decent amount thus far, Mitchel felt it only wise to put his camera to work for him and began shooting for the country/southern rock group Sierra Shame.

nm3976058,Nitin Upadhyaya,Nitin Upadhyaya,173,"Nitin Upadhyaya was born and brought up in Lucknow, a small city located in the Northern part of India. He attended a local Catholic School for his early education and throughout his early teens he wrote and staged many plays forming the first theatre group in the school. Despite being a below average student in academics, he got accolades from the teachers for his penchant for writing and also served as the Editor of School Magazine for 2 years. His exceptional theatrical skills earned him a seat at one of the most prestigious Film Schools in India but he was unable to pursue it due to family commitments. He subsequently settled for his average skills in science and started pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Engineering. Even during those Engineering years, his flame for creativity did not douse and he insistently struggled to give a new face to the College Theatre Group giving it a name that won honors in major University Theatre Competitions. He made his first short feature music video with a group of friends which inspired many students across India and earned him appreciation. He started his professional career as a Software Consultant for an MNC and moved to Kochi located in the Southern part of India which is drastically different from the rest of the country in terms of language, culture and food. Even though he was so far from his dream city and dream job, he did not let his determination falter. He played role as a Cinematographer for a Short Film shot in regional language there. After a struggle of one year he finally got transferred to Mumbai, the heart of Theatre and Cinema. While continuing his work at Wipro, he took his first step into the industry with the help of a Film Caterer in Film City. It was just a meager job of dropping Beta tapes for Edit. He worked during the day and did night shifts for a TV shoot. Since he did not have any relevant background in the field, he took up any kind of work to gain learning experience. These varied experiences have given him the unusual feat of working with cast, crew and film of all major Indian languages as First Assistant Director, Casting Director, Editor, Screenwriter, Line Producer, Executive Producer, Distributor and Director. It was the desire to learn in any possible way that got him involved in covering the 26/11 Terrorist Attack on the Taj single handedly for an Israeli News Channel. Due to widespread nepotism and lobbying in the industry he finally left working for corporate structures and started a Line Production Company Creative Roots India to help promote Independent Cinema in Mumbai. The company helps students from major universities abroad to make their Foreign Diploma Films in India. His venture Cinematically Correct promotes first time Film makers and produces several Short Featurettes in Mumbai. He is associating with Independent Film makers in Line Producing films throughout India thus promoting Indian Independent Film culture by helping them reach International audience and Inviting Foreign Independent projects to come shoot in India. His next goal is setting up an NGO called 'Free Spirit Foundation' to help bring out the creativity in the group of people who do not have access to the expensive technology thus giving them an opportunity for a career choice they would otherwise not be able to make.",,,,,,,,Maulshree Gangwar  (1 January 2011 - 13 July 2016) (divorced),1,1,0,0

nm3978932,Kenneth Stevenson,Kenneth Stevenson,183,"Kenneth Stevenson is an American Film & Television Director, Writer, and Producer with a style that fuses Southern Gothicism and Socio-Political Thrillers. Often collaborating alongside lifelong friend Andrew Bennett under the moniker The Versa Brothers-his work with Bennett focuses extensively on truth-seeking.Stevenson's influences stem heavily from the frenetic dialogue of Aaron Sorkin and the world-building, history, and mythology of Ridley Scott, George Lucas, and Damon Lindelof. Important tropes involved in Stevenson's work involve the solemnity of the passage of time, the loyalty that binds family and friends, the relativity of socio-political opinions, the reverence of the elderly, and the struggle of displaced transcendentalists. Stevenson frequently draws from themes present in punk / alternative rock music and Libertarianism (Counter-Culturalism, Self-Reliance, and Desire for Rebellion) to express his frustrations with extremist ideologies.In June of 2018, Stevenson's series Cerebral was recognized at SeriesFest as one of 13 official selections internationally in the Drama category. He has worked for Time Warner, SONY and been the recipient of various local film festival awards. His first feature film out of college was distributed internationally and led to his eventual introduction to television with a series he directed called Rapture-featuring Lew Temple (The Endless, The Walking Dead) and Rob Pralgo (The Vampire Diaries). While in school, his network blossomed from a club into the beginnings of a company due to a scholarship he received from David Letterman. It was at this point he met his two business partners: Co-Director / Producer / Writer Andrew Bennett and Senior Producer Dylan Pieri.A dual entrepreneur and artist at heart, Stevenson now operates Versa Media-- A Creative Development Company focused on original content for dramatic episodics & feature film.

He took the name 'Michael' from his father and granddad and 'Douglas' from his other granddad who died twelve years before he was born.As a young child, Ryan loved films and would repeatedly watch The Lion King, The Mask and surprisingly after much pleading, Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds.His first experience of acting was in primary school when he played a dragon. He was repeatedly told to be quiet at home for practicing his roar because his parents had no idea that he was just rehearsing for an upcoming part. During secondary school, Ryan was more interested in sports than performing, captaining his school football and cricket teams. It was only in his final year that he got involved with the annual school play.At 16, Ryan began studying Performing Arts at Wiltshire College, Trowbridge but dropped out at 18, just three months before finishing his second year because he started auditioning for various projects and wanted to focus on acting work. He worked on a couple feature films and short films before making the move to London in 2012 on the day of the Olympics opening ceremony. Shortly after arriving in London, he booked his first TV commercial for the UK Home Office and MTV working on an abuse awareness campaign to help prevent abuse in teenage relationships. He then went on to shoot campaigns for various brands including Proximus, Snickers, Popchips and Tog 24.To make money in between acting jobs, he would sometimes take random jobs abroad to satisfy his need for adventure and indulge in the different experiences life has to offer. One of these jobs took him to Finland for five weeks as an activity guide driving elves and families to various locations, creating fires in the snow and leading snowmobile excursions through the forest. Another job took him to France for six weeks to work on the horse team in the small north-central village of Fontaine-Le-Port.","March 18, 1992 in Trowbridge, Wiltshire, England, UK",1992-03-18,"Trowbridge, Wiltshire, England, UK",,,,,,0,0,0,0

nm4012517,Sherine Reda,Sherine Reda,,"A member of one of Egypt's illustrious families with unparalleled artistic heritage during the golden age of cinema, theatre and entertainment, Shereen Reda is an Egyptian actress, model and mogul. Shereen Reda began modeling at the age of 11 and thereafter turned to acting when she starred in the popular 1989 television program ""Fawazeer Al Fonoon"" which was presented by the late director Fahmy Abd El Hameed during the month of Ramadan. At the time, the successful television production was considered as one of the biggest and most elaborate shows on TV, and it was only natural for Shereen to pursue a career in entertainment following in the footsteps of her father Mahmoud Reda and his brother established the phenomenal Reda Group for Egyptian folklore dance, which was the first of its kind. Following her family's footsteps wasn't Shereen's only ambition. She studied fashion design in Los Angeles. Soon after, her second rise to fame came when she starred in two consecutive films with the late actor Ahmed Zaki, where she played the role of the deceived, classy wife in the film Nazwa (1996) and an innocent daughter of a corrupt wealthy man in Hassan El Lol (1997). Wanting to diversify and avoid being type-cast as the elegant, delicate girl, Shereen waited for the right role: in 2008 the role of a police officer soon became hers in the movie Ashraf Harami. She appeared as a guest star in the medical drama series Lahazat Hariga (Critical Moments) and in the sitcom Ragel Wa Sit Sittaat (A Man and Six Women). She took part in several television series for three consecutive years, such as Al Safa'a (The Slap), Bidoun Zikr Asmaa (Without Mentioning Any Names) and Al Morafaa (The Plea). Playing the character of Deja, the mysterious tattoo artist, Shereen returned to the silver screen in the film The Blue Elephant (2014), which was one of the most successful films of that year in Egypt. However in 2015, she surprised everyone with her powerful and deep performance in the film Out of Order, playing a widow who spends her life watching the world around her go up in flames, then enters into an odd relationship with a young man who leads a life close to that of a homeless man, and with whom she slowly slides into the world of drug abuse. Her performance in Out of Order brought her wide critical acclaim and won her the Best Actress award at the 42nd Egyptian Cinema Film Association Festival. Not only was this role a huge departure from her usual typecast roles of the classy woman, but the challenge of playing this character gave her a deeper understanding and a personal and artistic maturity in her work, something she wishes to use in her future projects, which would be a mix of experimental and diverse roles that would aid in discovering her hidden potential as an actress. This was obvious in her role in Photocopy film for which she won the Best Actress in a Leading Role award at the Egyptian Cinema Film Association Festival. Reda played another new and distinctive character in the film Al Deif (The Guest). She played Mimi, wife of an author and thinker who arouses controversy through his writings. Playing memorable roles each year, Reda is always keen on appearing in Ramadan TV series, including El Ahd (2015), Foq Mostawa El Shobohat (2016), La Totfea' Al Shams (2017), and Bani Youssef (2018).

And that is what she is doing.Coming late into the field, Brown feels she has been blessed with many life experiences that have prepared her for each and every character she has and will be cast in. She has played the gamut of characters that include an action fighter (Crisis Function and Crisis Function Awakening - still filming), a detective investigating corruption (Wages of Sin: Special Tactics - still filming), a jury member trying not to be swayed by her fellow jurors (12 Angry Women - still filming), a woman who discovers her boyfriend has been cheating on her (Pieces of David) and even a mother pushed to the edge (A Woman And A Gun)!But Brown has yet to accomplish her goal: Showing the world that a Type One Diabetic (T1D) can and will accomplish anything they desire and change the perception of diabetics in this industry. After almost 17 years as a T1D, Brown has overcome so much with her diabetes especially regaining the ability to walk after fighting diabetic nerve damage in her legs and feet almost nine years ago. And now, Brown wears her diabetes each and every day. Literally! She has an insulin pump and for some productions, the thought of having an actress with such a visible device for treatment has been a bit unnerving. But in the past few years, Brown has seen a change in which production companies are writing her character in as a diabetic who is strong and determined OR they allow the pump to be worn and shown without feeling the need to address it because it does not take away from Brown's ability to deliver the character.It is a slow change but it is one Brown is excited about accomplishing!

nm4039514,Bill Freas,William Jacob Freas III,175,"Born January 25, 1979 in Norristown, Pennsylvania, Bill began his work in the arts and entertainment industry at a young age. During his youth, he studied creative writing with renowned author and screenwriter S.C. Sykes. A state champion musician during his time as a student at Wissahickon High School in Ambler, Pennsylvania, Bill also performed professionally in the Philadelphia area with such dynamic, eclectic ensembles as The City Rhythm Orchestra/Big Band (bass trombone), The Black Eyed Peas Jazz Band (tuba), The Philadelphia Sinfonia II (tuba), The United States Army Reserve Bands (bass trombone), Purple Sunset (piano, keyboards, drums), and indie pop-rock band Marah (tuba).While at WHS, he won numerous music awards, including the prestigious John Philip Sousa Award, and earned top positions in major ensembles, including sweeping first-chair tuba distinctions in PMEA District 11 Band and Orchestra, Region 6 Band and Orchestra, and Pennsylvania All-State Band, all in his senior year. Over four years at WHS, he earned tuba seats in a total of eight PMEA band and orchestra festivals, as well as being chosen in back-to-back years as the bass trombonist for the elite Cavalcade All-Star Jazz Band. As his musical interests peaked, Bill studied intensive music theory and composition while learning to play every instrument. Following graduation from WHS in 1997, Bill continued his musical studies at West Chester University in West Chester, Pennsylvania, while maintaining his professional career as a performer, composer, and arranger.In 2000, Bill was hired to compose the musical score and theme for a Philadelphia-based television pilot produced by Ron Smolin for Fat Hat Films, Inc. That opportunity branched out to positions as head writer and cast member for the project, which garnered interest from networks such as TBS and Comedy Central. Following his involvement with the project, Bill began writing for film full-time and soon secured numerous deals for his projects with various international film companies. Over the next few years, he expanded his technical, business, and creative capabilities and began producing, directing, and acting as well. In 2011, Bill's first major directorial debut ""Ain't So Funny"", which he also wrote and produced, made its world premiere at the popular Blue Snowman Film Festival in Montreal, Quebec to rave reviews. In addition to writing for film, he has authored a satirical comedy book, an eclectic horror and sci-fi short story collection, and a number of acclaimed fiction works that have been published by several domestic literary entities in top-selling anthologies and literary compilations.Founded in 2010, Bill's production company, Crazy Owl Films, has worked in various development and production capacities on a number of film and television projects both in-house and outside of the company. The firm frequently partners with Canadian film label Foresight Entertainment to produce genre films such as ""Friends in Dark Places"", ""Nocturne Six"", and ""Shadow Hill"". In 2014, Crazy Owl Films expanded and opened a music division known as Crazy Owl Entertainment that composes and produces original music for established professional musical artists and for placement in film, television, and assorted multimedia projects. Bill's alma mater, Wissahickon High School, honored his school and career achievements by inducting him into its Hall of Fame in 2017.","January 25, 1979 in Norristown, Pennsylvania, USA",1979-01-25,"Norristown, Pennsylvania, USA",,,,,,0,0,0,0

nm4043618,Tom Holland,Thomas Stanley Holland,173,"Thomas Stanley Holland was born in Kingston-upon-Thames, Surrey, to Nicola Elizabeth (Frost), a photographer, and Dominic Holland (Dominic Anthony Holland), who is a comedian and author. His paternal grandparents were from the Isle of Man and Ireland, respectively. He lives with his parents and three younger brothers - Paddy and twins Sam and Harry. Tom attended Donhead Prep School. Then, after a successful eleven plus exam, he became a pupil at Wimbledon College. Having successfully completed his GCSEs, in September 2012 Tom started a two-year course in the BRIT School for Performing Arts & Technology notable for its numerous famous alumni.Holland began dancing at a hip hop class at Nifty Feet Dance School in Wimbledon, London. His potential was spotted by choreographer Lynne Page (who was an Associate to Peter Darling, choreographer of Billy Elliot and Billy Elliot the Musical) when he performed with his dance school as part of the Richmond Dance Festival 2006. After eight auditions and subsequent two years of training, on 28 June 2008 Tom made his West End debut in Billy Elliot the Musical as Michael, Billy's best friend. He gave his first performance in the title role of Billy on 8 September 2008 getting rave reviews praising his versatile acting and dancing skills.In September 2008 Tom (together with co-star Tanner Pflueger) appeared on the news programme on channel FIVE and gave his first TV interview. In 2009 Tom was featured on ITV1 show ""The Feel Good Factor"". At the launch show on 31 January he and two other Billy Elliots, Tanner Pflueger and Layton Williams, performed a specially choreographered version of Angry Dance from Billy Elliot the Musical, after which Tom was interviewed by host Myleene Klass. Then he became involved into training five ordinary British schoolboys learning to get fit and preparing their dance routine (fronted by Tom) for the final ""The Feel Good Factor"" show on 28 March 2009. On 11 March 2010, Tom, along with fellow Billy Elliots Dean-Charles Chapman and Fox Jackson-Keen appeared on The Alan Titchmarsh Show on ITV1.On 8 March 2010, to mark the fifth anniversary of Billy Elliot the Musical, four current Billy Elliots, including Tom Holland, were invited to 10 Downing Street to meet the Prime Minister Gordon Brown. It was Tom Holland who was chosen to be a lead at the special fifth anniversary show on 31 March 2010. Elton John, Billy Elliot the Musical composer, who was at the audience, called Tom's performance ""astonishing"" and said that he was ""blown away"" by it. Holland had been appearing on a regular basis as Billy in Billy Elliot the Musical rotating with three other performers till 29 May 2010 when he finished his run in the musical.In two months after leaving Billy Elliot the Musical, Holland successfully auditioned for a starring role in the film The Impossible (directed by Juan Antonio Bayona) alongside Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor. The Impossible was based on a true story that took place during the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. The film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 9, 2012, and was released in Europe in October 2012, and in North America in December 2012.Tom has received universal praise for his performance, in particular: ""What a debut, too, from Tom Holland as the eldest of their three lads"" (The Telegraph); ""Tom Holland, making one of the finest feature debuts in years"" (HeyUGuys); ""the excellent Tom Holland"" (The Guardian); ""The child performers are uncanny and there is an especially terrific performance from Tom Holland as the resourceful, levelheaded Lucas terrified but tenacious in the face of an unspeakable ordeal"" (Screen Daily); ""Young Holland in particular is astonishingly good as the terrified but courageous Lucas."" (The Hollywood Reporter); ""However, the real acting standout in The Impossible is the performance of Tom Holland as the eldest son Lucas. His portrayal is genuine, and at no moment does it feel melodramatic and forced. The majority of his scenes are separate from the lead actors and for the most part it feels like The Impossible is Holland's film"" (Entertainment Maven); ""Mr. Holland, meanwhile, matures before our eyes, navigating the passage from adolescent self-absorption to profound and terrible responsibility. He is a terrific young actor"" (New York Times).Tom has given a number of interviews about his role in The Impossible. In particular, he talked on video to Vanity Fair Senior West Coast editor Krista Smith and with IAMROGUE's Managing Editor Jami Philbrick. He has also given interviews to The Hollywood Reporter, to the MovieWeb, to Today Show on NBC and to other outlets. Tom's director and co-stars have also talked about him. Juan Antonio Bayona: ""He had this extraordinary ability to get into the emotion and portray it in a very, very easy way. The best I'd ever seen in a kid."" Ewan McGregor: ""It was wonderful watching Tom who had never worked in front of a camera before, to see him really get it and grow as a film actor as he went along. He's really talented and polite to everyone. It's very easy for children to lose perspective but he's absolutely on the right road and a brilliant actor."" Naomi Watts: ""He has an incredible emotional instrument and an unbelievable sense of himself... Tom Holland and I had a couple of moments where we came together and I could just tell how wonderful he was and what a beautiful instrument he had. It was just easy to work with him, that was one of the greatest highlights for me: discovering a friendship with Tom off-screen and this beautiful relationship between mother and son on-screen. The intimacy that develops through the course of the film between Lucas and Maria, I just loved that relationship. I mean, Tom is a beyond gifted actor. He's just a raw, open talent that is just so easy to work with. And Tom, he's inspiring, he kind of lifts everyone's game around him because he can do nothing but tell the truth. He was great.""In his turn, Tom Holland has returned favours to Naomi Watts when he was asked to present Desert Palm Achievement Award to her at Palm Springs International Film Festival. According to HitFix: ""One recurring theme of the night was how the introductions were often better than actual winner's speeches... The best intro, however, had to go to 16-year-old Tom Holland who intro'd his ""Impossible"" co-star Watts. Holland admitted of all of Watts' great performances his dad had only let him see ""King Kong"" and while they spent six weeks shooting in a water tank he didn't know it was ""difficult"" because he actually ""loved it""... Most important, this was Holland's first film role and he sweetly noted, ""From the moment I met you, you took my hand and you never let go."" Cue the ""awwww"" from the audience."" The presentation is available on video.In 2011, Holland was cast in British version of the animation film Arrietty, produced by Japan's cult Studio Ghibli. He has provided voice over for the principal character Sho. In 2012 Tom Holland played the starring role of Isaac in the film ""How I lived Now"", (directed by Kevin Macdonald) alongside Saoirse Ronan. The film was released in 2013.On 17 October 2012, Holland became a recipient of Hollywood Spotlight Award for his role in The Impossible. ""We are very excited that we will be able to recognize acting talents that are on the road to discovery and stardom,"" said Carlos de Abreu, founder and executive director of the Hollywood Film Awards in a statement. On 6 December 2012 it was announced that Holland became a winner of the National Board of Review award in the ""Breakthrough Actor"" category. In the end of December 2012, Holland was voted a winner for the year's Best Youth Performance in Nevada Critics Awards.In December 2012, Holland received a number of nominations for his role in The Impossible: for the 18th annual Critics' Choice Movie Awards, in the ""Best Young Acror/Acress"" category; for Chicago Film Critics Association Awards 2012 in the ""Most Promising Performer"" category; for the 27th Goya Awards in the ""Best New Actor"" category; for the Washington D.C. Area Film Critics Association Awards 2012 in the ""Best Youth Performance"" category; for the London Film Critics Circle Awards 2012 in the ""Young British Performer of the Year"" category.Kristopher Tapley, Editor-at-Large of HitFix, reported on 27 August 2012 that Summit Entertainment, the company responsible for distribution of The Impossible in USA, would be campaigning Holland rather than McGregor as the lead, and strongly argued that Tom Holland deserved to be nominated for an Academy Award in the Best Actor category. The fact of long-listing for an Academy Award was confirmed in the article in the Hollywood Reporter: ""And though McGregor stars as his father in the film, Holland has been submitted as the lead actor for awards consideration. Regardless if he receives any nominations, his performance as the strong-willed and determined eldest son is garnering critical acclaim.""As one of the most promising young actors, Holland was featured in Screen International's ""UK Stars of Tomorrow - 2012"" and in Variety's ""Youth Impact Report 2012"". Holland has been signed up by William Morris Endeavor (WME) global talent agency and is represented by Curtis Brown literary and talent agency.In 2015, Tom was cast as Peter Parker/Spider-Man in Sony and Marvel's films. He has played the role in Captain America: Civil War (2016), Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017), and Avengers: Infinity War (2018).","June 1, 1996 in Kingston upon Thames, England, UK",1996-06-01,"Kingston upon Thames, England, UK",,,,,,0,0,0,0

With no connections to the film industry, he spent his formative years studying the films screened on Turner Classic Movies; and watching Dark Shadows reruns on SciFi Channel, which instilled in him a great love of the occult and the macabre. He is a fully self taught filmmaker - making his own productions - first on mini-VHS tapes with his Universal Monsters action figures, and later with friends from school, learning and honing his craft with each production.Supported by his family and a talented repertory company of actors, he has directed eight feature films and countless short subjects, operating on a budget of chewing gum, shoestring, and sheer determination.He first gained attention with his revisionist Doctor Mabuse films, the first of which premiered in limited theatrical release in May 2013, with its follow up feature releasing the following year.In 2014, he wrote and directed a 6-part anthology series Theatre Fantastique, featuring Sally Kirkland, Christopher Pennock, Lisa Blake Richards, Jerry Lacy, and Lara Parker. In 2017, he directed a second season - the complete series was later released to DVD by Alpha New Cinema. The series introduced eccentric characters such as the Murderous Mahones and Madame LaSoeur.In 2015, his Lovecraft Noir feature film The Last Case of August T. Harrison, starring Jerry Lacy and Nathan Wilson, made the rounds at film festivals across the country.Between 2015-2017, he worked on The Detective Adam Sera Chronicles, a comic book style serial based upon characters Faraj invented in high school (and explored in an earlier student film trilogy in 2010 with character actor Linden Chiles.) The series takes place in the alternative ""Lost Angeles"" and followed the fantastical misadventures of disturbed Detective Adam Sera and his friend and superior Lt. Craig Hargroves and the gallery of rogues they face in their dark world.In 2018, his film, Will & Liz: a love story in Venice Beach, starring Nathan Wilson (who co wrote the film with Faraj) and Christine Tucker - was released on Amazon Prime Video.His latest film is Loon Lake, a psychological thriller starring Nathan Wilson and David Selby, shot on location in Minnesota.He intends to explore the worlds of Detective Adam Sera, Madame LaSoeur and Doctor Mabuse in future films.

Listening to hip-hop, and specifically its use of static in music, prompted Ben's first forays into manipulating sound. By high school, Ben had become a fixture around the station, which earned him an invitation from JP-Chill to try his hand at some on-air mixes. He was sold.He continued his sonic explorations at the California Institute of the Arts, where he studied synthesis, signal processing, acoustics, music theory, and composition, and earned a bachelor's degree in music technology. While at CalArts, Ben also delved into world music, studying Balinese gamelan, African drumming and hand percussion. Ben's multi-layered musical sensibility combines hip-hop, electronic, world music and classical composition.In 2007, Ben collaborated with composer Joby Talbot on the score to Wayne McGregor's ballet, Genus, based on Charles Darwin's theory of evolution, commissioned by the Paris Opera Ballet.

She is best known for her roles as Maritza Ramos on the Netflix series Orange Is the New Black and Lina on Jane the Virgin. Among her other roles was a recurring role on Are We There Yet? Guerrero grew up in Boston and remained there after the rest of her family was deported to Colombia. She is an advocate for immigration reform. Her role on Orange Is the New Black has twice contributed to wins for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series.Guerrero was born in New Jersey to Colombian parents and raised in Boston, Massachusetts. As the only member of her immediate family with United States citizenship (by virtue of being born in the country), she remained in the U.S. when her parents and older brother were deported back to Colombia when she was 14. Her parents had pursued legal citizenship, but had been fraudulently represented. Guerrero's niece, who also grew up without a strong family support system, later served time in jail.Guerrero was raised in the Jamaica Plain and Roxbury neighborhoods of Boston after being taken in by other Colombian families. She has had an interest in acting since a young age and took advantage of free opportunities in the neighborhood or at school. Then she attended Boston Arts Academy, a performing arts high school, where she was in the music department. Among her high school activities was singing with a jazz group, but she anticipated pursuing political science and communications in college. In 2010, she appeared in the Faces music video that was shot in Norwood, Massachusetts for Louie Bello. Her first job after college was in a law office. At age 24, she decided to pursue a career in acting. In 2011, she moved to New York City and studied acting at the Susan Batson Studios where she met her manager Josh Taylor. Guerrero's life experience compels her to advocate for immigration reform and is an influence that she draws upon in her acting.She auditioned for a role on Devious Maids, but was cast in Orange is the New Black, where she plays a Bronx-bred character that is likely Puerto Rican. For season 2, she was part of the cast that earned recognition for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series at the 21st Screen Actors Guild Awards. The cast earned recognition for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series again at the 22nd Screen Actors Guild Awards. She has had a recurring role on Are We There Yet?.In 2014, she appeared in Emoticon ;), a comedy about a May-December romance in which her character's father is involved with a doctoral candidate. Her performance in this film as Amanda (""Mandy"") Nevins, an adopted teenage child, elicited positive criticism such as a description of a ""well-drawn smaller moment"" that was ""beautifully rendered"" according to Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter and a performance that ""command sympathy"" according to Inkoo Kang of the Los Angeles Times.One of her upcoming roles is as an 1800s Cuban confederate spy, loosely based on the life of Loreta Janeta Velazquez, for Peter and John. She was cast in The CW's series Jane the Virgin in a recurring role. In February 2015, Guerrero was cast as the female lead in CBS' television pilot for Super Clyde, but the show was not picked up for series when CBS announced its fall schedule in May. Guerrero has upcoming film roles in Happy Yummy Chicken, Beyond Control and The Godmother.In 2016, Guerrero released In the Country We Love: My Family Divided a memoir about her parents being detained and deported when she was fourteen.

In the Fall of 2017, Thai starred in a feature film Anabolic Life, which premiered to rave reviews, calling his performance ""Stellar"" and his performance immediately created buzz that he was very much a natural born ""Standout"" star. The film also gained him new fans/supporters around the country with many leaving the theaters wanting to know more about him after seeing his groundbreaking performance in the film.
